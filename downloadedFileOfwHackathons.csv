we want to dedicate one day to spontaneous indoor and iBeacon hacks. just to open up our imagination and think of the immense opportunities indoor location and iBeacons could offer to our society. how we could connect physical and digital worlds in a playful, useful and innovative way to benefit consumers, venue owners, event organizers, researchers, kids, parents, old people,... etc. etc. \\r\
