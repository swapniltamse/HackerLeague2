\\r\
Dentists today are using 3D Volumetric Image Centers and Laboratories. To communicate with dental image centers dental offices had been using computer protocols such as DDX Dental Data Exchange to improve Machine to mMachine communication and software platforms. We would like to develop some cloud solutions to make better internet data exchange. \\r\
\\r\
Digital Dentistry is also starting to use every day more mobile devices. Mobile devices are becoming important part of the dentist workflow in platforms like iphone, android, windows mobile, linux mobile, blackberry, etc.\\r\
\\r\
Come and meet with dentists, metal ceramic experts, programmers, developers, designers, technicians to develop the next generation dental applications for any platform.\\r\
\\r\
What to Bring:\\r\
\\r\
Your laptop and cables.\\r\
\\r\
The hardware platform(s) you are developing for, such as tablets, smartphones, NFC chips, Google TV, Apple TV, Roku, etc.\\r\
\\r\
Cameras, microphones and any other equipment you think you will need, if you are planning to create original video content on-site for your app (however, we will have video assets available, if you would prefer to use them).\\r\
\\r\
Any software and apps you need in order to create your app or front-end design.\\r\
