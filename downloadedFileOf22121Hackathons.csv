\\r\
Hearst Hack Week is the first-ever internal hackathon at Hearst! The Corp Tech team has been working on a Hearst-wide API platform and we\\u2019re thrilled to debut it during this hackathon. \\r\
\\r\
---------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
### Who can participate?\\r\
\\r\
We want to keep logistics manageable for our first event, so this internal hackathon will be open only to US-based Hearst employees.\\r\
\\r\
---------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
### When and where is it?\\r\
\\r\
Hearst Hack Week is a week-long event starting Friday, October 17th and ending the following Friday, October 24th, 2014. \\r\
\\r\
Friday, 10/17, 4PM ET @ MagLab room (11th floor, Hearst Tower) - Event kick off and API demos, happy hour!\\r\
*WebEx link will be provided to those attending remotely*\\r\
\\r\
After kick off, you\'re free to hack on your own time and wherever you want throughout the week.\\r\
\\r\
Friday, 10/24, 3PM ET - Project submission deadline. Submit your projects through the projects tab on Hacker League.\\r\
\\r\
Friday, 10/24. 4PM ET @ 44 East, Hearst Tower - Presentations and judging, closing happy hour\\r\
*WebEx link will be provided to those attending remotely*\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
---------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
### How do I get started?\\r\
\\r\
In order to participate, you must first register as a participant in this Hacker League portal and then request Hearst API access through our [Hearst Developer Portal](http://developer.hearstlabs.com). See \'How to get API access\' wiki page.\\r\
\\r\
As soon as you get your API key, we encourage you to check out the [Hearst I/O Docs](http://developer.hearstlabs.com/io-docs) to play with and test calls on some of our Hearst APIs before heavy-duty coding begins.\\r\
\\r\
We encourage you to form your teams ahead of the kick off on 10/17 so you can get started right away. Once you have an idea for a hack, you can submit it as a project in this Hacker League portal so others can see them and request to join your team.\\r\
\\r\
On the kickoff, we will also announce those projects that are still looking for team members as well as hackers looking for projects to make the process easier.\\r\
\\r\
BTW, you can get started hacking as soon as you get granted API access.\\r\
\\r\
---------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
### What are the APIs I can play with?\\r\
\\r\
 - [Content Enrichment](http://developer.hearstlabs.com/data_services/content_enrichment) - This API provides access to all digital content from Hearst\'s Magazine, Newspaper, and Broadcasting properties. The content has been enriched with data including a unified cross-group classification and including article view counts. \\r\
\\r\
For a complete list of available APIs, visit [developer.hearstlabs.com](http://developer.hearst.com). Hack away!\\r\
\\r\
---------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
### Introducing the Hearst Knowledge Boards!\\r\
(available starting Tuesday, 10/14)\\r\
\\r\
An easy way to reach fellow hackers and ask questions to Hearst employees. You can select a skill, and post a question which creates a forum thread and sends an email to those employees with that skill listed on their Hearst Labs profile.\\r\
\\r\
For Hack Week 2014, please type in \'HackWeek2014\' as a skill in order for your question to be emailed to all participating hackers. See more info and pictures on the Hearst Knowledge Boards wiki on the menu above.\\r\
\\r\
To access the Hearst Knowledge Boards, visit [hearstlabs.com](https://www.hearstlabs.com/), then on the header menu, select GROW, then Knowledge Boards.\\r\
\\r\
### Ahem. Grand Prize!\\r\
\\r\
The best hack will receive a $500 AMEX gift card!\\r\

Apple says that \\"iOS 8 is the biggest release for developers since the introduction of the App Store. It opens up new areas of iOS, allowing developers to extend the reach of their app content and functionality. It includes over 4000 new APIs to enable amazing features and capabilities.\\"\\r\
\\r\
We\'ve taken a look at some of the upcoming features and we think that App Developers are going to have a field-day integrating IDOL OnDemand with Swift to create amazing Custom Actions, cool new Widgets for the notification center, and most of all, we\'re excited for the new Documents extension capabilities.  \\r\
\\r\
With all this power at your fingertips, we say \\"Go BIG, or go home!!!\\"\\r\
\\r\
We want you take a little more time than usual for this challenge. We\'re giving you 30 days to figure out how to transform the way users interact with their iPhone with IDOL OnDemand, and we urge you to create an unbelievable experience with your new app. Remember that sometimes it\\u2019s the small things and what goes on under the covers in your code that make the biggest difference to how a user interacts with their phone, so don\\u2019t underestimate the value of great user experience over excessive front-end functionality.\\r\
\\r\
IDOL OnDemand is a complete solution for bringing extensive data analytics to your app and for augmenting your mobile solution using REST APIs.\\r\
\\r\
Through our Early Access program, we\\u2019re exposing the capabilities of HP IDOL (Intelligent Data Operating Layer), the world\\u2019s leading on-premise human information processing engine, as a managed solution to deliver a broad selection of web services to developers.\\r\
\\r\
The true power of IDOL OnDemand is evident when you start to combine the APIs. Consume IDOL OnDemand Indexing APIs to index your unstructured data from social media, mobile devices, CMS, Google docs, Dropbox, email, SharePoint or other sources. Once indexed, analyze and augment your content, using IDOL OnDemand APIs such as OCR, Sentiment Analysis, Extract Entity, Face Detection, Barcode Recognition and Text Extraction. Finally, leverage IDOL OnDemand Search APIs to find what you need and shine light on dark data with advanced search options such as Find Similar, Query Text Index, Find Facets, Clusters or Terms.\\r\
\\r\
Will your app make the device an afterthought, with an experience that is so natural, the user forgets they\\u2019re actually using a phone?","external_url":"http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30045514/?type=develop","state":"complete","start_time":"2014-09-15T16:00:00Z","end_time":"2014-10-14T16:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/54234eb9c3b748df1e00001a/original.png?1411600054","students_only":false,"total_hackers":9,"total_hacks":0,"location":{"city":"www.topcoder.com","state":"www","country":"United States"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/ios8-swift-hackathon-by-hp-idol-ondemand-go-big-or-go-home"},{"id":"53bfcb0058cc84a9b9000001","name":"Music Hack Day Amsterdam","slug":"music-hack-day-amsterdam","description":"Music Hack Day Amsterdam kicks off on October 10 and you\'re all welcome to join!\\r\

Green Hackfest kicks off in Utrecht on the Netherlands National Day of Sustainability starting Friday, October 10th running through to Sunday October 12th for a full weekend of massive green hacking with the theme of applied sustainability - where coders, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, hardware hackers, UX and UI specialists, scientists and others come together and brainstorm over a couple of days and build out their ideas in a short term innovation event known as The Green Hackfest.\\r\
\\r\
Driven by Europe\'s Climate Kic, one of the world\'s largest public-private innovation partnerships focused on climate change and consisting of dynamic companies along with the best academic institutions and the public sector - along with UtrechtINC, a business incubator with an accelerator program... the Green Hackfest 2014 will offer over 10,000 euro in prizes, three days of hacking, two nights of accomodation at the venue and the opportunity to show work to some of Europe\'s top players in the Green movement.\\r\
\\r\
It\\u2019s all about applied sustainability - which is the application of science and innovation to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet. A more refined definition would be called Just Applied Sustainability: the application of science and innovation to ensure a better quality of life for all, now and into the future, in a just and equitable manner, whilst living within the limits of supporting ecosystems.\\r\
\\r\
In this three day (two night) hackathon starting Friday afternoon and running through to Sunday evening (October 10-12, 2014), we are bringing together talented and bright developers to work on inspiring ideas, apps, games & smart solutions that have a direct impact on peoples awareness and/or their daily life and actions to help improve and sustain the living environment and nature.\\r\
\\r\
By tapping into the many APIs and SDKs from Green  technology companies, and more than 100 publicly available APIs, participants of all skill areas will team up to cultivate new ways of solving old problems--brainstorming over two days to build new friendships and networks, and most importantly, design new products and services.\\r\
\\r\
##Horizon 2020 Fund and Green Hackfest##\\r\
\\r\
In addition to creating great solutions with brilliant people, don\\u2019t miss this unique opportunity to network with key people from Climate-KIC who hold the purse strings to the billions of euro slated for Green funding from the Horizon 2020 programme. \\r\
\\r\
Horizon 2020 is the largest government fund for innovation the world has ever seen, with \\u20ac80 billion available overall.\\r\
\\r\
##New Technology and Green##\\r\
\\r\
Web and mobile-based devices are becoming increasingly important in tooling humans to better tackle the issues of sustainability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these technologies, Green Hackfest 2014 will bring together a wide range of bright, enthusiastic people with multiple talents. Together they will use these technologies to address current Green challenges and present the results back to those attending the event.","external_url":"http://the-hackfest.com/events/green-hackfest-utrecht-2014.html","state":"complete","start_time":"2014-10-10T12:57:00Z","end_time":"2014-10-12T11:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/53ff435c3ee676d936000015/original.png?1412945002","students_only":false,"total_hackers":52,"total_hacks":14,"location":{"city":"Utrecht","state":"","country":"The Netherlands"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/green-hackfest-2014-for-green-urban-living-eu13-500-prizes"},{"id":"541f72f691b541588c000048","name":"ZenHack 2014 Fall","slug":"zenhack-2014-fall","description":"<\\u7985 \\u3068 IT \\u3067\\u4e16\\u754c\\u306e\\u8ab2\\u984c\\u306b\\u6311\\u3080>\\r\

\\u3000Why Zen?  To answer that question, it is the only way to be in Zen temple, feel the vibe, get inspiration from whole environment. Zen is unspeakable spiritual method. It\\u2019s essence only be concieved when you actually experience Zen.\\r\
\\r\
\\u3000Why  IT?  It reminds us that Steve Jobs worshiped the Zen spirit.

\\r\
The [Network Dynamic and Simulation Science Laboratory](http://www.vbi.vt.edu/ndssl) is hosting a **Computing for Ebola Challenge** from October 3-10, 2014. We originally organized the event as a campus activity, but we\'ve seen so many great examples of civic hacking that we\'re inviting the whole internet to join.\\r\
\\r\
**We need people of all skill sets - not just hackers.** We want people to build apps, do data entry, design educational materials, and more. Even if you don\'t write code, you can help!\\r\
\\r\
### Goals\\r\
The goal of this challenge is to develop an app that helps fight the Ebola outbreak. It can be a mobile app, a web app, a standalone program, a visualization, or even just spelunking the internet for hard-to-find data. Examples include analyzing epidemiological data, or building an app that connects people with certain skills to NGOs recruiting volunteers.\\r\

### How to get started\\r\
To get started, sign up to participate. You can join alone, or you can form a team. Then visit our [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/hackebola/) or [etherpad](https://beta.etherpad.org/computingforebola) to view and contribute project ideas, explore resources, and chat about the challenge with other participants. Also check out the Ebola data is available on [github](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola).\\r\
\\r\
Then on Oct 3, get started! It\'s a one week sprint to do as much as we can to advance the effort to control Ebola. When the challenge finishes on Oct 10, post your project to the Projects page to share what you\'ve accomplished.\\r\
\\r\
If you are involved in the Ebola response and have any project requests (or even if you aren\'t involved, but have a great idea), email cmrivers@vbi.vt.edu.\\r\

The grand prize winners provided three submissions in one:\\r\
\\u2022 Interactive Exploration of Late-Night Taxi Patterns\\r\
\\u2022 Late Night MBTA Ridership \\u2013 Comparison of Changing Use and Cost \\r\
\\u2022 Exploration of Late Night Travel Patterns\\r\
The submissions included maps, charts and an interactive graphic. The analyses focused exploring late-night taxi location data, comparing late night T usage to normal weekday use, and analyzing the cost per trip, induced demand, comparison with earlier MBTA \\u201cNight Owl\\u201d\\r\

####Best MBTA API App\\r\
[MBTA Travel Pro by Mitesh Patel ]\\r\
(https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/the-late-night-t-data-challenge/hacks/mbta-travel-pro)\\r\
MBTA Travel Pro enables users to track the real-time location and arrival/departure times for various routes mass transit routes in and around Boston. The app allows users to customize their view to quickly display their favorite line and real-time-updated location and wait time for the arrival of their particular travel mode: bus, subway, train, or boat. The application is specifically designed for Windows Phone 8 and above with seamless integration with phone operating system.\\r\
\\r\
####Best Historical Data Tool\\r\
[Late Night T Data Explorer by Matthew Danish]\\r\
(https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/the-late-night-t-data-challenge/hacks/the-late-night-t-data-explorer)\\r\
How have usage patterns of the late night MBTA and Taxi services changed between 2013 and 2014? We can explore this question using these three interactive charts, that provide several views of the late night T and Taxi data. Using the interactive charts, users can select different slices of information to be presented. Compare year-over-year differences at various times of night, select a particular weekend day, a set of transit routes, or taxi-trip starting ZIP codes to view.\\r\
\\r\
Comparison is provided of comparable weekends year-over-year, from February 28th up to early June, to provide a glimpse of the change before and after the initiation of late night service on March 28th.\\r\

Overview\\r\
--------------------------------------------\\r\
MassDOT and the MBTA are excited to announce a 12-week data challenge that will release the MBTA\'s late night ridership data as well as a new version of the API for the T\'s real-time data. \\r\
\\r\
####Purpose\\r\
The goals of the challenge will be to highlight the MBTA\\u2019s late night service as well as see how it and other on-demand services such as Uber are contributing to Boston\'s culture shift towards later hours. The City of Boston is exploring how to offer more amenities later into the night to make itself a more attractive destination for people to live and work; one that is not restricted by traditional hours of operation.  MassDOT and the MBTA want to know how late night service is changing the way people think about accessing and traveling around the city. \\r\
\\r\
On a parallel track, the MBTA has released a new API for real-time information. The new API is an exciting improvement for developers that currently access the MBTA\\u2019s real-time data, because the common platform will allow for the visualization of all of our data on all modes side-by-side in one application. The new MBTA-realtime v2 API integrates predictions and alerts together for MBTA subway, commuter rail, and bus in one easy-to-use interface. Check the GitHub site for information on the API\'s new formats, calls and fields. They make it easier than ever to develop a wide variety of applications using MBTA data. Find out more on the API at the data challenge GitHub site:\\r\
https://github.com/MassBigData/LateNightT/\\r\
\\r\
####Goals\\r\
1. Explore the ways that late-night MBTA service is being used, opening opportunities, and changing the region\\r\
2. Promote new apps that use integrated real-time and alert data for MBTA subway, bus, and commuter rail service\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
####Schedule\\r\
Friday, June 20th: late-night data and description of new API become available \\r\
Tuesday, June 24th: demonstration version of new API available to work with\\r\
Wednesday, July 2nd: Meet-up/team building event\\r\
Thursday, September 5th: Submission deadline (extended!)\\r\
\\r\
####Prize categories\\r\
1. Best exploration of late-night ridership \\r\
2. Best exploration of the opportunities that late-night service opens up\\r\
3. Best app to that uses many different kinds of information published through MBTA-realtime\\r\
4. Most original or creative new application to use MBTA-realtime data\\r\

FAQ\\r\
 \\r\
What should I bring with me?\\r\
\\r\
A laptop, charger and lots of good ideas and enthusiasm.\\r\
\\r\
Will there be free WiFi?\\r\
\\r\
Yes, free WiFi will be provided throughout the day, but feel free to also bring mobile broadband dongles as backup.\\r\
\\r\
How can I host my application on the day?\\r\
\\r\
Free hosting will be provided for the day; feel free to spin up and spin down an allocation of cloud servers as required.\\r\
\\r\
What can I work on?\\r\
 \\r\
We would encourage development of all sorts of applications that use data innovatively \\u2013 big and smaller data alike \\u2013 to help public sector and government departments.\\r\
 \\r\
Please submit ideas for projects that you\\u2019ve considered but not had the time or skills to develop, or even projects that you\\u2019ve started that need an extra hand to get moving again. This is an opportunity to work with some of the very best developers from across the public sector, in conjunction with the MongoDB tech team, to bring ideas to life and showcase.\\r\
\\r\
Can I join as an individual?\\r\
\\r\
Yes, we welcome individuals as well as small teams.\\r\
\\r\
What happens if I create an app that rocks?\\r\
\\r\
Great! That\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019d like to see. Hackers retain all copyright and we\\u2019d encourage open source projects to be born on the day.\\r\
 \\r\
I have an idea for an app, how can it be developed at the hackathon?\\r\
\\r\
We aim to crowdsource ideas from across the public sector community in the lead-up to the day. A website will soon be online to help capture your ideas and enable you to see other proposed hacks. Start your own or join one you would find interesting and feel you can contribute.\\r\
 \\r\
How are the teams composed?\\r\
 \\r\
We would really like to see multi-agency, multi-discipline teams so best practice and experience can be shared. It\\u2019s also hopefully a great opportunity for you to network and meet new colleagues. Using the website, you\\u2019ll be able to self-organise and attach yourself to a project that interests you.\\r\
 \\r\
Will there be prizes for the winning apps?\\r\
 \\r\
Yes, sponsors will be providing prizes. Stay tuned for more details.\\r\
 \\r\
I\\u2019m not a developer, can I still join in?\\r\
 \\r\
Of course. Teams may need assistance with frontend graphic design and system/database administration, as well as good technologists to think through the concepts. Just because you may not be directly cutting the code doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re not welcome or useful to a team.\\r\
 \\r\
Will the hackday be featured online?\\r\
 \\r\
Yes, we anticipate interest from the media and we will be actively tweeting developments throughout the day. We encourage everyone to join in. We plan to live stream the demos at the end of the day so anyone interested that couldn\\u2019t make it can tune in and contribute on Twitter \\u2013 and a recording will be available for anyone that missed out. \\r\
 \\r\
Will there be technical assistance from MongoDB?\\r\
 \\r\
Yes, the MongoDB technical team, including solution architects and engineers, will be on hand to help you as you develop throughout the day.\\r\
 \\r\
How will the end-of-day demos work?\\r\
 \\r\
We will be providing each team up to 10 minutes to showcase their efforts, with 5 minutes dedicated to a live demo and 5 minutes for Q&A with the audience and the judges. This will be your chance to shine and impress the judges and also to receive valuable feedback from others.

## The Mass EduData Challenge\\r\
\\r\
The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) maintains extensive data sets on education from all of the state\\u2019s 351 cities and towns and is seeking to spark additional engagement and innovation around its data through the launch of the Mass EduData Challenge-  a six week competition aimed at engaging the public in viewing, analyzing, and visualizing Massachusetts educational data to produce new insights, tools, and opportunities to improve outcomes and drive social benefit in the Commonwealth.\\r\
\\r\
Visualizations and insights produced through the Mass EduData Challenge hold the potential to impact the awareness and understanding of education data across the Commonwealth, helping to inform and drive decisions around funding, achievement, equity, and future policies.\\r\
\\r\
The data is available now and the Mass EduData Challenge will official kick-off on Wednesday, May 28th with a \\u201cTeam Building & Mentoring Event\\u201d hosted at hack/reduce \\u2013 the Cambridge, MA based community \\u201chackerspace\\u201d. At the event, participants will be encouraged to review the data, connect and consult with domain experts, and begin to form both their teams and the foundation for their ideas for eventual submission.\\r\
\\r\
The data challenge is designed to encourage participants to choose their own most compelling \\u201clens\\u201c through which to analyze the data, which may include: illustrating relationships involving funding, tests scores, or distribution and predictability of educational outcomes.\\r\

\\r\
http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/zapphack-reviveretail-tickets-11856373733\\r\
\\r\
THE CHALLENGE\\r\
Mobile payments will revolutionise the retail industry, and so far we have only just scratched the surface of what possibilities it will open up. We challenge you to develop, test and innovate around user cases and scenarios where pain-free mobile payment can improve the customer or retailer experience whether that be on mobile, online, in store using bluetooth, beacons, QR codes, expandable range screens- the possibilities are endless.\\r\
The retail world is facing some tough challenges \\u2013 the high-street downturn combined with the rise in demand for mobile shopping being one of the big ones.  Research shows conversion from mobile shopping is less than 1%, indicating a clear problem.\\r\
\\r\
How can you turn this into opportunities using the functionality afforded by pain-free mobile payments to help you offer an amazing customer experience and ultimately achieve more sales?\\r\
\\r\
WHO\'S BEHIND ZAPP?\\r\

## What is trivago?\\r\
\\r\
![trivago](http://ie1.trivago.com/images/layoutimages/mars/logo_ci/logo%402x_.png \\"trivago\\")\\r\
trivago is the world\\u2019s largest hotel search website, with over 700,000 hotels, 150 partner websites and 45 million monthly visitors. But trivago is more! With employees from all over the world, trivago is an international IT company constantly implementing the newest technology. Over 100 IT specialists are currently working on the continuous development of the high-traffic metasearch engine at the company\\u2019s headquarters in Dusseldorf.\\r\
\\r\
## What is this Hackathon about?\\r\
\\r\
This hackathon is all about the topic \\"Geodata\\".\\r\
What Geodata is, this will be decided by you itselfs. \\r\
It can be simple longitude and latitude, weather data, location services or everthing else related to \\"Geo\\" and \\"Data\\" ;)\\r\
\\r\
trivago does not limit you in ideas about the topic, used technologies, concepts or anything else.\\r\
\\r\
### Dataset\\r\
\\r\
To enable some kind of idea we offer a data set.\\r\
This data set is not a working API.\\r\
It it just a plain MySQL-Dump or file full of CSV-Values.\\r\
\\r\
This data represents a simple search on one of our trivago platforms (like http://www.trivago.com/). \\r\
One search contains various properties like:\\r\
\\r\
* Year / Month / Day of search\\r\
* Platform of the search (e.g. http://www.trivago.it or http://www.trivago.es/)\\r\
* City / Country / Continent which was searched\\r\
* Longitude / Latitude of the searched city\\r\
* Arrival / Departure date of the search\\r\
* and some information where the user comes from\\r\
\\r\
Of course it is not a requirement the data. But it maybe helps :)\\r\
\\r\

We will show the County\'s commitment to technology, increase awareness about open data, reach out to citizens and allow for easier use of public data.\\r\
\\r\
RivCodes means \\u201cRiverside County Developer Event\\u201d and refers to our application programming event (Hackathon) that we are having to create applications based on open data.  App Contests have become popular fueled by President Obama\\u2019s Open Data policy and the need for better ways to communicate with citizens. \\r\
\\r\
This event is a call to action for anyone in the Riverside County area who wants to make an impact; anyone can get involved, regardless of professional experience.  Projects can address any challenge facing the community. RivCodes will illustrate the power of open government practices, particularly where data is readily available to support meaningful collaboration.\\r\
\\r\
Examples of applications that have been created at other agencies are \\u201cWhere to find services\\u201d, submitting a crime tip to the sheriff\\u2019s dept., reporting potholes, or a checkbook showing how the County spends money and many others.  \\r\

\\r\
Living in a democracy implies that citizens can check the procedures of their government, elections being their main participation in that democracy. Since e-voting has been introduced in Belgian elections, citizens thus have to be able to double check these electronic methods.\\r\
\\r\
This is an open call for an open citizen audit of the Belgian e-voting systems, to be held in Antwerp on Sunday Jun 15 2014, 10:00-21:00. \\r\
\\r\
What is the state of the Belgian e-voting system? \\r\
===\\r\
\\r\
How and why did the Brussels voting fail? Is the code safe from fraud? Is the vote counting bullet proof? Is the software secure? Is communicated data securely and correctly encrypted/decrypted? Can the QR codes on the Smartmatic ballots be spoofed or are they vulnerable to fraudulent payloads? What other leaks or holes or security flaws can you detect in the voting system? Is e-voting vulnerable to attacks? Can it be improved?\\r\
\\r\
The Belgian federal authorities of internal affairs (\\"Binnenlande Zaken\\") have published the source code of the e-voting on 28 May 2014 at http://www.ibz.rrn.fgov.be/index.php?id=3285&L=1 For faster downloads, it is also available as a torrent at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63152/elections.torrent\\r\
\\r\
Although there is an independent expert team hard at work on a parliamentary requested audit, we have started wondering what the citizens can do with the code base, can we openly and ethically test its implementation ourselves? \\r\
\\r\
We\'re organising a hackathon to challenge the code base!\\r\
\\r\
Start now!\\r\
---\\r\
\\r\
Please download the source code and start exploring right now, you may be able to prepare something special to do at the event, to share knowledge and to collaborate on projects on top of the code base. An audit is a first start. But playing Tetris on a voting machine would be cool, too!\\r\
\\r\
If you are planning on dropping by, please join Hacker League and join this event. You can create teams and projects with friends and colleagues. Please share your ideas as soon as you have them. Link to github repos, datasets, modified VMs, whatever you come up with!\\r\
\\r\

---\\r\
\\r\
As far as the day goes, we may have an interesting talk on the state of e-voting in Belgium, plenty of time to collaborate on studying the code, and possibilities to spread the word on stuff you have learned.\\r\
\\r\
The hackathon is scheduled for 15 June 2014, from 10:00 to 21:00 at Telenet Idealabs, which is easily accessible by public transport, in the centre of Antwerp (see http://telenetidealabs.be/#contact).","external_url":"","state":"complete","start_time":"2014-06-15T08:00:00Z","end_time":"2014-06-15T20:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/538648d82d6dcc8161000001/original.jpg?1401309394","students_only":false,"total_hackers":5,"total_hacks":0,"location":{"city":"Antwerp","state":"Antwerp","country":"Belgium"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/citizen-audit-of-the-belgian-e-voting-system"},{"id":"535965ba383347c05300000d","name":"Fishackathon","slug":"fishackathon","description":"Fishackathons across the United States kick off on June 13th at 7pm (local time) and you\'re invited to take part in the festivities. \\r\

-----\\r\
\\r\
[itvt] is pleased to announce the tvot^ Hackathon 2014, a unique event that brings together hackers, directors, and other creatives and experts from the worlds of television, online video, advertising, big data, visual and sound design, display technology, art, music and beyond, to envision and build the TV of Tomorrow.\\r\
\\r\
#### What is the TV of Tomorrow?\\r\
As with our last two Hackathon events--the tvot^ Hackathon 2013 and the TVOT NYC Hackathon--we\'ll leave that entirely up to your vision and creativity! However, it could encompass such platforms, technologies, user experiences and media as the second screen (smartphones, tablets, etc.), the cloud, game consoles, advanced set-top boxes, smart TV\'s, gestural control, voice control, automatic content recognition, augmented reality, virtual reality, rich interactivity, binge-viewing, big data, metadata, gamification, personalization, audience participation, social media integration, geolocation, tcommerce, advertising, branded content, micro-video, transmedia storytelling, and more.  \\r\
\\r\
#### When:\\r\
The tvot^ Hackathon 2014 will take place 9:00AM, June 7th-5:00PM June 8th (Saturday-Sunday). The finalists will then be showcased and the grand prize winner selected June 10th in a special session at The TV of Tomorrow Show 2014 (TVOT 2014), an event that attracts many of the leading figures of the advanced-TV industry.\\r\
\\r\
#### Where:\\r\
The tvot^ Hackathon 2014 will take place at the SPUR Urban Center, 654 Mission Street, San Francisco, California--an architecturally significant building located in the heart of the City\'s Yerba Buena district.\\r\
\\r\
#### How to Register:\\r\
Registration is free, but spaces are limited. So register here soon to reserve your place. Please note that registered tvot^ Hackathon 2014 participants also qualify for discount admission to The TV of Tomorrow Show 2014 (TVOT 2014). Email swedlow@itvt.com for more information.   \\r\
\\r\
<http://bit.ly/1p0EglB>  To Register!\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
#### The Challenge:\\r\
Hackers will be challenged to envision the TV of Tomorrow by conceiving, designing and building TV/video apps and experiences, primarily--though not exclusively--using technologies, platforms, content and knowledge contributed by the Hackathon sponsors. Participants are free to implement their visions of the TV of Tomorrow however they wish. While they will receive points for every participating company\'s technology that they employ, they will be judged primarily on the originality, elegance and usefulness (viability, scalability, monetizability etc.) of the app or experience they create.\\r\
\\r\
#### Who should participate?:\\r\
The tvot^ Hackathon 2014 is open to \\"hackers\\" of all kinds, including coders, but also visual and audio designers, content visionaries, business visionaries, students, storytellers, directors, producers, artists, advertising gurus and others.\\r\
\\r\
#### What To Expect:\\r\
The tvot^ Hackathon 2014 will last 36 hours, and food and drink will be provided. Representatives from the Hackathon hosts and the other participating companies and organizations will be on hand to provide advice on using their platforms, content, API\'s and other technologies. In addition, you\'ll be able to participate in breakout sessions with other advanced-/interactive-/social-/multiplatform-TV experts/mentors who can provide you with guidance and inspiration. Once you have completed a prototype or real implementation of your project, you will be asked to pitch it to a panel of judges who will select the three finalist projects that will be showcased at TVOT 2014. The winner, finalists and runners-up will also be featured in a special issue of the [itvt] newsletter, the first, best and most widely read publication on the interactive-TV industry.\\r\
  \\r\

#### I Just Want to Hang Out and Watch--Can I?:\\r\
The tvot^ Hackathon 2014 will be a highly enjoyable and very social event, that will present great opportunities for schmoozing and networking.

\\r\
With key figures who hold the purse strings to over \\u20ac10 billion euro of health funding from the EU Horizon 2020 programme at the World Research and Innovation Congress (http://wric-health.com/) for Health in Brussels, Health Hackfest 2014 (http://the-hackfest.com/events/health-hackfest-brussels-2014.html) is an amazing opportunity for both sponsors and participants alike to gain knowledge and build networks with organisations and people who have been slated to deliver massive investment into health innovation in Europe over the next six years as part of the largest ever government fund for innovation the world has ever seen at \\u20ac80 billion euro. \\r\
\\r\
Funding is not restricted to European companies, and consortia with participants from around the world are welcome to tap into the monies being made available. \\r\
\\r\
Organisations attending WRIC Health bridge both academia and commercial and with the core tenet of Horizon 2020 focussing on SME participation, this is a perfect opportunity to build new bridges and networks for all involved. \\r\
\\r\
The bulk of the funding being made available from the EU at WRIC Health is slated for non-drug research, but rather - for software and hardware solutions - as technology plays a pivotal role in the new Horizon 2020 framework.\\r\
\\r\
Health Hackfest 2014 has been launched as a platform designed with a pure objective to deliver hacked solutions and inventions, empowering those with brilliant ideas to take on a host of challenges and drive innovation in health.\\r\
\\r\
The \\"Health Hackfest\\" hackathon, held in Brussels and run over two days (June 4-5, 2014) was created for software developers, hardware hackers, designers, researchers, entrepreneurs, business developers and even healthcare professionals wanting to be a part of having a positive impact by helping to create future solutions for Healthcare.\\r\

# Event\\r\
A \\"tele-hackathon\\" that teams students in Palo Alto, Oxford, and Tanzania to work together on projects via video link. Sequel to the [Tanzania-MIT Tele-Hackathon] (http://allafrica.com/stories/201308190100.html)\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
# Mission\\r\
We think that one of the best ways to learn something is to hang out with people who are doing it for fun and that one of the greatest untapped potentials of the Internet is to expand cultures of learning without geographic boundaries. Moreover, we\'re working to integrate telehackathons into online courses to make them more than passive lectures.\\r\

The teams will present their projects to a panel of judges, who will provide feedback and comments on potential market impact. The audience will also have chance to vote of their favorite apps. Teams will have access to rich troves of data through Application Programming Interfaces (\\u201cAPIs\\u201d) and datasets provided DOE\\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\\u201cNREL\\u201d). In addition, Geostellar, Genability, Solar Nexus, Clean Power Research, Sun Number and other DOE SunShot Incubator grant awardees will also open their API and provide access to their datasets. The unique focus of this event will be to unlock the potential of these data stores and deliver results integrated with compelling solutions aimed at motivating consumers to adopt solar energy.\\r\
\\r\
With these APIs, software developers will be able to explore innovative ways to integrate solar energy production calculations, broad market analytics, incentives, utility rates and other important data elements in their applications. APIs will also be available for the submission of information from consumers, solar equipment companies, financing providers and solar installers.\\r\

Please come prepared to build some awesome hacks! If you\\u2019ve never written code or participated in a hackathon before, don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll have some great mentors from leading NYC tech companies to assist you!\\r\
\\r\
Some things to keep in mind between now and then:\\r\
\\r\
1. Teams: Feel free to form a team before the event. Teams should be no larger than 4 people. If you prefer to work alone or don\\u2019t have a team, that\\u2019s fine too, we\\u2019ve got you covered!\\r\
\\r\
2. Sleep: Please arrive well rested! This is a 24/hr event and you\\u2019ll want to be on your A-game for the whole thing. We\\u2019ll have plenty of coffee and sodas to keep you going! \\r\
\\r\
3. Ideas: There is no theme for the hackathon. Your goal is to use technology to solve a problem in your life or the lives of others. Try to think of things that would be great to have or do with a computer, but don\\u2019t already exist (or taking something existing and improve upon it). Again, don\\u2019t worry; we\\u2019ll have engineers on standby to help you with an idea.\\r\
\\r\
4. Food: We\\u2019ve heard your cry and delivered! With the help of our friends at IBM and cater2me we\\u2019ll be providing tacos, bagels, sandwiches, pizza and more. \\r\
\\r\
5. Technology: We have some computers available, but if you have one of your own, please bring it.

\\r\
==Rules==\\r\
Registration for the Hackathon is day-of. \\r\
\\r\
===Submission Requirements===\\r\
\\r\
Register your team day-of. Write a good description of your project (1-2 sentences). Set up a github repo (private) for your team day-of. You will use this repo to submit your project.\\r\
\\r\
Github has excellent tutorials on how to use git and how to setup a repository on github. This type of technology can be life-saving for group projects. For those who know svn, you can use svn with github via git+svn. http://help.github.com/\\r\
\\r\
===Judging Criteria===\\r\
\\r\
Completion will be a factor in judging but submissions will not be disqualified for lack of completion.\\r\
\\r\
Bugs are okay! You\'re building a quick hack, not production-quality software!\\r\
\\r\
If you make any special claims about the capabilities of your software, please present proof of your claims in your presentation.\\r\
\\r\
The presentation itself doesn\'t need to be super-high quality - we understand you\'ll probably be sleep-deprived and not all there. But don\'t forget to substantiate claims!\\r\
\\r\
The description is not graded, but it will be used to help the judges refer to teams\' projects while judging.\\r\
\\r\
===Exceptions to the Rules===\\r\
\\r\
Yes, you can code alone or in pairs or in a group of 5 if you want, but we\'re only handing out 1 prize to a lone star, 2 prizes to a team of 2, proceeding up to 4 prizes for a team of 4+ people. You\'ll have to distribute the prizes amongst your group.\\r\
\\r\
To be eligible for prizes, your team must consist entirely of CAL undergraduates, with teams of 4 or lower receiving preference. The point of this hackathon is to write that hack you\'ve always wanted to do, or really want to do right now! Prizes, while super awesome, are merely an incentive to get you to stay up all night long, as is the 24 hours of food.\\r\
\\r\
There are 3 large prize groups! 1st place winners get first pick at the prize groups, then 2nd place group, then 3rd place. That means 1st place winner may choose the 2nd place price if they desire. \\r\
\\r\
===Pre-Hackathon Okays and NotOkays===\\r\
\\r\
All code written must be written in the 18-hour period, or explicitly flagged as written beforehand.\\r\
Making significant use of pre-written non-framework/non-library code is strongly discouraged.\\r\
Libraries are totally fine.\\r\
Anything reasonably called a \\"framework\\" should be fine.\\r\
Improvements to a library may not be considered in the main body of a work if they are merely incidental to the project, rather than a major component.\\r\
Non-coding design pre-work is acceptable.\\r\
Likewise for product development.\\r\
Fleshing out and preparation work, in general, should be no big deal.\\r\
If a project does not pass a \\"smell test\\", judges may, at their discretion, take this factor into consideration when evaluating the project.\\r\
It is recommended that a README file be included which explains the necessary disclaimers for pre-work, libraries, etc., and summarizes the work done. However, this is neither required nor scored.\\r\
\\r\
Have fun with this project. If you\'re not having enough fun, take a quick nap or grab a snack. \\r\

We\'ll be developing tools that Texas libraries and others can freely use to power new and transformative explorations of our digitized cultural heritage, based on the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) API.\\r\
\\r\
DPLA is a platform that enables new and transformative uses of digitized cultural heritage materials, based on a metadata repository that provides read-only access to millions of records from across the United States via an open API. Texas content is currently provided by the Portal to Texas History at the University of North Texas, one of nine DPLA Service Hubs, and by content contributed by DPLA Content Hubs. In this workshop, participants will actively code against the DPLA API to build or enhance apps, visualization tools, plug-ins, and other interesting tools that make use of DPLA data.\\r\
\\r\
The DPLA encourages the development of apps and tools by developers of all skill levels and backgrounds; there are no strict boundaries on the types of apps accepted, except that they be open source (the DPLA platform is released under a AGPLv3 license) and interoperable with the DPLA platform.  DPLA API queries are returned as JSON-LD, and the metadata is freely reusable under a CC0 public domain license. A front-end portal is currently available at <http://dp.la>; prospective workshop participants are encouraged to explore the portal to see what types of materials are available.\\r\
\\r\
This FREE hackathon will provide some background on DPLA and the DPLA API, but it will not provide a structured introduction to programming. Active participation is highly desired, so workshop participants should have at least some prior experience of working with APIs or with interface development in PHP, Ruby, Python, or Java. Participants should provide their own laptop computers with appropriate development environments; power and wireless Internet access will be available courtesy of the Texas Digital Library and The University of Texas at Austin Libraries. \\r\
\\r\
Technical Notes: The DPLA codex is available at <http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/>. Participants should request an API Key prior to the workshop at <http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/#get-a-key>. Please review the API Basics (<http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/api-basics/>) or browse the apps page (<http://dp.la/apps>) to see some examples of production apps. DPLA has made sample code and libraries for Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Node.js (<http://dp.la/info/developers/sample-code-and-libraries/>), which may provide a useful starting point for development. A troubleshooting and FAQ page (<http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/troubleshooting/>) is also available.","external_url":"https://conferences.tdl.org/tcdl/index.php/TCDL/TCDL2014","state":"complete","start_time":"2014-04-27T18:00:00Z","end_time":"2014-04-27T22:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/533192fb88a6f4251d000003/original.png?1395757817","students_only":false,"total_hackers":24,"total_hacks":2,"location":{"city":"Austin","state":"TX","country":"USA"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hacking-dpla-at-tcdl"},{"id":"5328f877a58fc98cd5000004","name":"DocGraph Virtual Hackathon 2014","slug":"docgraph-virtual-hackathon-2014","description":"[DocGraph](http://docgraph.org) is amassing the most accurate map of the Healthcare system every built and releasing it as an open data set.\\r\

\\r\
The Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists at Rutgers will be hosting its bi-annual hackathon \\u201chackRU: A Scarlet Night of Hacking\\u201d for the fourth time!\\r\
\\r\
The event is a 24-hour hackathon. It will begin on April 12th at 2:00pm and conclude on April 13th at 5:00pm EST. We will have several companies presenting their technologies so that students can create original applications in unique and interesting ways. Last semester, we had over 250 students in attendance with over 50 projects presented.\\r\
\\r\
This event is open to anyone willing to spend the weekend hacking for honor and glory. There is no limit to the size of a team but remember that the bigger the team, the harder it is to manage a project. We are looking forward to seeing some awesome hacks and some awesome hackers.\\r\

Come to the BeMyApp Factory Hackathon and build a connected device! \\r\
\\r\
This is a hackathon for inventors, builders, coders and designers who want to create a connected device, NOT for those who want to create an app for a current connected device - so no we won\'t have Glass, Pebble, UP, etc.\\r\
\\r\
The winning team will get hands-on consulting sessions with 219 Design, a product video funded by us, help creating a beautiful prototype, media coverage and help from the BeMyApp Crew :) So, if you\'re passionate about what you\'ll be building, be ready for the chance to work hard to launch a crowdfunding campaign for your amazing product. By the way, commitment and dedication to continue the project will be on the judging criteria list. \\r\
\\r\
Even if you come with a team, you will still need to pitch your idea Friday night to get feedback from the mentors! Idea pitches need to be turned in by 3/20. Feel free to email/call before that to chat about your idea. \\r\
\\r\
It\\u2019s ok for you to bring an idea that you\\u2019ve worked on, but you have to build a prototype from scratch during the hackathon. \\r\
\\r\
Please BYOH, but as promised, we will also be hooking you up with components as well. Electric Imp, will have Imps for anyone who wants to use one for their project!  That being said, there are no requirements regarding what components you use-as long as you build a connected device of some sort! \\r\
\\r\
We will have all the components on this list (https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/73653) as well as arduino boards, beacons and BL boards, and some other goodies. We will also have a couple soldering stations, an oscilloscope, a voltmeter, a logic analyzer, some wire strippers, a dremel and some hand tools (but please bring some if you have em!)  \\r\
\\r\
Just remember, we are not a store so we will not have everything you can think of. If you already know you need something specific, BRING IT! \\r\
\\r\
We\\u2019re partnering with TechShop, Electric Imp, 219\\r\
Design, Whistle, MbientLab and SparkFun (so far!)  Big shout out to Sandbox Suites for hosting us! We cant wait to see what you crazy inventors get up to!

During this event some prompts for tools to help fight slavery will be presented.  Then we will go to work.  \\r\
\\r\
Prompt 1)\\r\
Labor trafficking vertical - a policy analysis, an industry analysis:\\r\
 \\r\
This would an analysis of the businesses and areas that labor trafficking is most prevalent.  Here we would be looking at both case studies of past businesses that have been found guilty and looking for common themes.  Additionally we\'d see if there are any explanatory geographic features which encourage slavery, like wide open spaces versus the city.  Finally, we\'d look at policy questions like, what laws work best to keep rates down?\\r\
 \\r\
Prompt 2)\\r\
 \\r\
Reporting - a mobile app:\\r\
 \\r\
This tool would allow people to quickly report an incidence of human trafficking.  They could optionally upload a picture and an extended description of the type of trafficking they witnessed.  A short message, the location of the text, and the date of incidence would be required.\\r\

### What?\\r\
\\r\
Music therapists help people access music, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, and use music to help them communicate, express themselves, and enhance their lives. This first-of-a-kind event will create a space for hackers to develop innovative tools for music therapists to use in therapeutic and healthcare settings. This Berklee Music Therapy Hack--cohosted by Berklee College of Music and hack/reduce--aims to create a new vision of what music therapy does and can do.\\r\
\\r\
### How?\\r\
\\r\
Practicing music therapists and music therapy students will present hack participants with problems to be solved in real-life settings. Assisted by a group of expert mentors, teams will have 24 hours to prototype innovative ideas using state-of-the-art technology and tools. Teams will then present their projects to a distinguished panel of judges, who will ultimately award a $5,000 cash prize for the best hack. \\r\

The Intel\\u00ae CCF SDK hackathon at the 2014 Mobile World Congress WIPJam is intended for engaging with developers who want to add multi-device / multi-user connected features into their mobile applications.  Intel\\u00ae CCF allows users on Windows, Android and/or iOS devices to find, connect, share and play (or work) both in proximity as well as over a cloud transport.  The CCF SDK plugs into a mobile app and handles all the heavy lifting for advertisement, discovery and connection, so that developers can focus on delivering a great experience instead of the heavy lifting on the communications software.\\r\
 \\r\
In conjunction with this WIPJam hackathon, Intel is launching the CCF portal on the Intel Developer Zone (http://software.intel.com).   For early access to the SDK and documentation, please follow the steps below:\\r\
\\r\
Step 1: [Sign up](https://secure-software.intel.com/partner/app/registration/developer?locale=en-us) for an IDZ account\\r\
Step 2: Login to IDZ with your developer account\\r\
Step 3: Sign up for access to the CCF SDK [here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/form/500471)\\r\
Step 4: Watch for approval email from CCF Team with follow on information and instructions\\r\
  \\r\
Requirements for .NET developers:\\r\
\\r\
\\u2022\\tMinimum one PC with Windows 7 or Windows 8 operating system for the development system\\r\
\\u2022\\tMicrosoft Visual Studio 2010 or newer \\r\
\\u2022\\tA second PC or Android device to show the P2P capability\\r\
\\r\
Requirements for Android developers:\\r\
\\r\
\\u2022\\tMinimum one PC running Windows 7 or Windows 8 operating system for development.  (Can also \\r\

\\u2022\\tMinimum one Android device running OS V4.0 or above for development \\r\
A second PC or Android device to show the P2P capability\\r\
\\r\
Winning apps will leverage the CCF SDK to build a cool multi-user / multi player / multi-device connected app or game that works between and among at least two smart devices (PCs, tablets, and/or phones).  Additionally, apps that run across both Windows and Android devices are encouraged but not required.   Judges will be looking for creative uses of the multi-device connected features of CCF to deliver a new social, interactive, competitive or collaborative application.\\r\

Description\\r\
---------------------\\r\
The Innovation Mashup Hackathon is based around innovation and creativity. At the GSMA we want to stimulate mobile development and enable innovation across the types of application being developed. In particular, the GSMA particularly values concepts using NFC, commerce, operator based (network) APIs, personalisation and identity.\\r\
\\r\
To enter the hackathon, all we ask of you is to create an application which uses a variety of different APIs across various different categories. So, if you want to mashup an app which uses Android NFC APIs together with an OpenID personalisation solution, Google maps and some sort of music, then that is great.Judging will be based around a set of criteria which looks primarily at your ability to mash together different APIs as well as being able to think \\u201coutside the box\\u201d. You\\u2019ll get more points if you think creatively. We\\u2019re not looking for commercial apps \\u2013 we want to see your new ideas. Perhaps you can take an existing idea and add something like NFC to it.\\r\
\\r\
We\\u2019re welcoming your ideas and questions online and we\\u2019re happy to give some feedback in advance of the event but please save most, if not all, of your development activity until the hackathon!!! We\\u2019d rather see it rough around the edges than see something you are just about to launch anyway.\\r\
\\r\
Challenge\\r\
---------------------\\r\
Your challenge is to create an application which innovates across the wide variety of different API categories. You can use the capabilities provided on-site (Operator APIs, NFC and RCS) as well as a variety of different publicly available operator APIs and other online capabilities.\\r\
\\r\
Get your creative juices flowing and create great apps with great user design.\\r\
\\r\
Technologies\\r\
---------------------\\r\
NFC, Network APIs, Voice APIs Plus anything else you want to add\\r\
\\r\
Prizes\\r\

#Welcome to Canada\'s Largest Hackathon.\\r\
 \\r\
Montreal. February 22/23rd. 500 of the best from all over the world. $30,000 in prizes. Are you ready?\\r\
 \\r\
Questions? Hit us up at contact@mchacks.io or on twitter (http://twitter.com/mcgillhacks) or facebook (http://facebook.com/mcgillhacks\\r\
 \\r\
**Who\'s invited?**\\r\
If you\'re an undergraduate from any university, from any country, you\'re welcome! If you\'re in high school or a grad student, get in touch with us and we\'ll do this on a case by case basis. Bring Student ID!\\r\
 \\r\
**I\'m not close to McGill. Can I get reimbursed for travel?**\\r\
We will reimburse attendees up to $200 for bus, train, and economy flight tickets. This is only if\\r\
A) Not travelling from the Montreal area or\\r\
B) Not on one of routes for the various busses we\'re sending out (these will be announced soon)\\r\
Make sure to bring your valid government photo ID and receipt with ticket details.                             C) You/your team submits a hack\\r\
 \\r\
**How big should teams be?**\\r\
Teams are capped at 4 people. Don\'t worry if you don\'t have a team, we\'ll help you find people to hack with before the event. It\'s also ok to go it alone, but it probably won\'t be as fun.\\r\
 \\r\
**What\'s the format?**\\r\
Anything goes! Web, desktop, mobile, and hardware projects are all welcome. (All hacks should be computer-related, though.) Projects will be judged based on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness.\\r\
 \\r\
**Can I keep working on a past project?**\\r\
No, start fresh. If you do decide to skirt this rule, let us know so we can judge your work fairly. Using third-party APIs and libraries is definitely okay, as long as they\'re accessible by everyone else as well.\\r\
 \\r\
**What if I\'m a noob?**\\r\
This is a great oppurtunity for you to learn how to hack! We\'ll have lots of evangelists walking around and some fantastic tech talks lined up. Please note that we only reimburse travel if you submit a hack.\\r\
 \\r\
**What should I bring?**\\r\
Bring whatever you hack with, a student ID and whatever you\'re hacking on like a device or hardware.\\r\
\\r\
**Where can I submit a resume?**\\r\
Stay tuned! We\'ll sending more infomation on resumes and waivers in a few days.","external_url":"http://mchacks.io","state":"complete","start_time":"2014-02-22T16:30:00Z","end_time":"2014-02-23T23:30:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/52c4bb5217adeaf11b000002/original.jpg?1388624719","students_only":true,"total_hackers":18,"total_hacks":0,"location":{"city":"Montreal","state":"Quebec","country":"Canada"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/mchacks-2014"},{"id":"52fc582e832c0925b9000015","name":"Code Across Puerto Rico 2014","slug":"code-across-puerto-rico-2014","description":"Join the **[Code for Puerto Rico Brigade](http://code4puertorico.github.io/)** for CodeAcross 2014! **[CodeAcross Puerto Rico](http://code4puertorico.org/codeacross/)** is a two day event beginning on Feb. 22 and running through Feb. 23.\\r\

Whether you\'re a designer or a developer, a copywriter or a coder, working in tech or at a creative agency,Goodby Silverstein & Partners invites you to join us for a hackathon event we\'re calling Hack SF.\\r\
\\r\
San Francisco Bay Area nonprofits La Casa de las Madres, the Eviction Defense Collaborative, and Goodwill of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin will kick off the event by talking about their missions. Each organization will also share one key challenge it faces that, if addressed, would have a significant positive impact on its ability to fulfill its mission.\\r\
\\r\
Hackathon teams will then have 24 hours to come up with their best ideas. Ideas may range from affordable-housing fixes to apps to beautification projects or business ideas that will help the nonprofits fulfill their missions. Really, it\\u2019s up to you.\\r\
\\r\
We\\u2019re confident that putting a bunch of creative people together for a weekend will lead to some innovative solutions.\\r\
\\r\
We\\u2019ll also have a bunch of different APIs and databases you can work with from the city of San Francisco\\u2019s Open Data Portal.\\r\
\\r\
You don\\u2019t need to have an idea or a team formed before you come to the event. Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting other people and coming up with your own idea during the event.\\r\
\\r\
An idea by itself lives only in the mind of an individual, but an idea shared among many can become reality. Join us!\\r\

EVERYONE (Whites, Asians, Latinos, old, young, men, women, and so on) is invited to register for this event.\\r\
\\r\
A Silicon Valley that lives up to the dreams of Dr. King is our vision for the first global hackathon for Black Male Achievement and Oakland\\u2019s first Startup Weekend. Startup Weekend is a global grassroots movement of active and empowered entrepreneurs who are learning the basics of founding startups and launching successful ventures. Headquartered in Seattle, it is the largest community of passionate entrepreneurs and innovators with over 400 past events in 100 countries around the world in 2011.  From Mongolia to South Africa to London to Brazil, people around the globe are coming together for weekend long workshops to pitch ideas, form teams, and launch their ideas.\\r\
\\r\
But this Startup Weekend will be different...\\r\
\\r\
Similar to Startup Weekend Women events, Startup Weekend Oakland will be an inclusion vertical by focusing on progressive community problem solving supported by diversity of though and collaboration among all ethnicities and genders.  The types of problems we are encouraging entreprenurs to tackle are revealed by statistics ranging from health, to education, to incarceration rates which reveal that Black men are a vulnerable population in the United States, particularly young Black males.\\r\
\\r\
Trayvon Martin\\u2019s tragedy opened up a global conversation on race, class, stereotype threat, and begs the question, can innovation in technology and business create an opportunity for a safer society for us all?  As a community of technologists and startup founders in Oakland, we recognized an opportunity to bring this conversation home to the Bay Area in a way that will unite us all around solving problems that hit closer to home and change change our world forever. If you are looking to find a technical co-founder for your venture, want to test out your app development skills, or use lean startup methods to find the best approach to solving a problem, you\\u2019ll find it here at Startup Weekend Oakland.\\r\
\\r\
Diverse Teams\\r\
\\r\
To support the assembly of diverse teams for this event, we are recruiting from organizations like The Hidden Genius Project to ensure that there will be plenty of young Black males excited to work alongside you during this event.  There will be five tracks to choose from:\\r\
\\r\
Education\\r\

##Music Hack Day returns to MIDEM for the 4th time!\\r\
\\r\
The MIDEM Hack Day, in partnership with Music Hack Day, is our way of showing the MIDEM attendees a cross section of the hacks that have been built across the year, and to show them just how much can be achieved by letting 30 developers spend a weekend hacking on open data and innovative music APIs in an unrestricted environment.\\r\
\\r\
##The differences\\r\
It\\u2019s important to note that this won\\u2019t be a normal Music Hack Day, which are usually held separately to any other events, as well as being completely open and free to attend. But it will very much held in the spirit of it Music Hack Day. The previous 3 years at MIDEM have been a great way to showcase to a MIDEM audience what is possible when you bring the worlds of developers, APIs and music together.\\r\
\\r\
Whilst everyone treads the floors of the busy conference, 30 music hackers from a range of disciplines and companies will be elsewhere in the Palais, getting together to build some compelling new music apps in roughly 48 hours.\\r\
\\r\
##The outcome\\r\
These new apps will be unveiled and demonstrated at the end of the MIDEM Hack Day and will also be accompanied by two other sessions to give the opportunity for MIDEM delegates to come along and find out more about what Music Hack Day is and why we do it.\\r\

\\r\
Transformational entrepreneurship, building scalable businesses with moral ethos.\\r\
\\r\
With mobile devices enabling the majority of the human population to access the Internet, the barriers to transformational entrepreneurship continue to decline. What is impeding such potential is not a dearth of ideas or resources, but a dearth of execution. Over a single weekend, you have the opportunity to build and launch a transformational startup, one with a strong business case and strong potential to transform for the better. The New York innovation community will provide you the tools you will need; you only need supply the ambition to do well and do good.\\r\

\\r\
It\'s likely that fewer than ever will go vote in 2014. One of the reasons is that we don\'t know what the European Parliament has achieved since the last election in 2009. We need to make its work and main achievements more visible to the voters and push people to better understand and look at the facts when casting their vote.\\r\
\\r\
People might vote based on emotion, but the choice should be based on information. If you think politics is nurtured on facts; if you think that your fellow citizen will become more involved in the elections if they get the chance to learn what the Parliament has actually achieved or how it has failed we are on the same page. Democracy needs informed citizens and politics would be better with more people watching and participating outside on the inner circle. The participants of the Hackathon 2014 aim at fixing just that and we want to make the Parliament more interesting and appealing ... based on facts. We know that data by itself is not interesting enough (at least not for the vast majority) - so we need activists and journalists to know what data to look for, statisticians and developers to extract the relevant information, and datavisualisation and user interface artists to make the facts clear and readable. And all of the above to promote the awesome stuff we\'re going to build.\\r\
\\r\
We need to work together to make data speak clearly - we need to work together to make politics and Europe more interesting to the voters. We need to tell the politicians we are watching, and they need to run on what they\'ve done, and anchor their election promises on their actions.\\r\
\\r\
We are inviting coders, activists, graphists and journalists to meet in Brussels on 24-26 January 2014 (last weekend of January) to a Hackathon.\\r\
\\r\
During this weekend we are going to work on several projects aiming at better telling the story of the European Parliament. We will create small groups of 2 to 4 people mixing competencies and having them generate a mini-site, and infographics, a chart... whatever they think is the best tool. We have experience participating in similar \\u201csprints\\u201d. It\'s intense, includes very little sleep and way too much coffee, furious coding and writing, resulting in lots of energy and the pleasure of having built something in a very short amount of time.\\r\
\\r\
We already have half a dozen signed up and we expect to be between 10 and 20. We don\'t want to make it too big, as it needs to stay focussed, but pretty sure I\'d love to have you joining in.\\r\

The folks in charge of the portal, the OGCIO, are organising an app competition with HK$140,000 in cash prizes. We want to enable you to give it your best shot, so we\'re organising a dedicated hackathon where you can team up and collaborate on ideas for the competition.\\r\
\\r\
The Data.One app competition is developer oriented, but don\'t let that dissuade you from joining the hackathon. The most effective teams are multi-disciplinary and it may take an edge to win. Creativity, Originality, Design and UX each have their own award categories, so I wouldn\'t count yourself out just because your keyboard produces music instead of code.\\r\
\\r\
The hackathon follows a familiar format; all participants are expected to join Wednesday\'s Catalyst night, where people have a 1 minute pitch for each of their ideas. Each pitch closes with the number and type of team mates that is required to build a prototype within the weekend. Ideas are voted on to get a sense of which projects have popular support. At the end of the night all the teams are formed, and the projects are set in motion. The weekend itself is spent building the projects. At 18:00 on Sunday all teams present their prototypes and people can vote on their favourites. We\'ll leave cash prizes up to the Data.One Competition :)\\r\
\\r\
Make.02 consists of two events. Both of which you\'ll need to attend, as teams for the weekend are formed at the Catalyst night.\\r\

Use it well and get ready for some pretty tough mental exercise on 17 January. The date marks the launch of BrainCode Mobi#1, the first event dedicated to mobile in the series of brain-signed Allegro Group meetings. This time, we meet at the Pozna\\u0144 University of Technology to see if we handle developing an app for a mobile platform within just a little over 24 hours.\\r\
\\r\
Coding starts 17 January (Friday) at 16:00 and ends the next day (Saturday) at 18:00. Participants will compete in two categories:\\r\
* The best use of Allegro.pl API: Use available Allegro.pl API to develop an app for any mobile platform\\r\
* The best native mobile app: Develop any app using SDK available for a desired mobile platform\\r\
\\r\
The teams of max. 4 members will be put together on the get-go \\u2013 volunteers will reveal their ideas for apps and invite those interested to join them.\\r\
\\r\
## To come or not come?\\r\
BrainCode Mobi#1 is for everyone keen on mobile programming: students making their first steps in mobile technologies and people dealing with them by profession or as a hobby. Developers, testers, UX designers...\\r\
\\r\
Along with the competition, Friday will see a number of open workshops giving an insight into Allegro API and mobile programming. Our work mates will talk from the stage (Piotr Orzechowski, Adam Gic, Andrzej Przyborski, Przemys\\u0142aw Wyrobek, Mateusz St\\u0119pniak and Mariusz Wojtysiak) and serve as experts (Andrzej Przyborski \\u2013 Android, Piotr Makowski \\u2013 Android, Adam Gic \\u2013 iOS, Dawid Ma\\u0107kowiak \\u2013 WP;  Mariusz Lisiecki \\u2013 iOS).\\r\
\\r\
The jury will include those who handle mobile in Allegro Group on a daily basis: Magda Sita and Piotr Orzechowski.\\r\
\\r\
## Lots of information and fun\\r\
\\r\
The event will welcome many interesting individuals, coders of all platforms, industry experts, colleagues in the profession. There will be a chill-out zone, games, massages and short quizzes to stimulate your brain, sole and physical strength. Nobody will sleep this night \\u2013 guaranteed!\\r\
\\r\
Awards will obviously go to the best: electronic equipment (tablets, smartphones and more) and gadgets from the organisers.\\r\

\\r\
###***Background***:\\r\
NYC [**311**](http://www1.nyc.gov/311/index.page) provides access to non-emergency City services and information about City government programs. 311 receives over 65,000 customer inquiries daily through its website, call center, text service and mobile app.  \\r\
\\r\
###***311 Today***:\\r\
While 311 is known as the way to submit requests and reports to City agencies, 70% of customer inquiries are resolved simply by providing information.  From parking and recycling rules to birth certificates, all of 311\'s content is available through an [**API**](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/reinvent-311-mobile-content-challenge/wikipages/528d0dbc0f3aad4f2e000007) (application programming interface) - but it\'s not yet widely available in the mobile space.  \\r\
\\r\
###***Reinvent 311 Challenge***:\\r\
[**The City of New York**](nyc.gov), [**Code for America**](http://codeforamerica.org/) and [**Stack Exchange**](http://stackexchange.com/) have come together to invite urban technologists, content creators, media professionals, civic developers and interested hackers to partner with NYC 311 to better integrate fundamental customer service information into new or existing mobile digital tools.\\r\
\\r\
To register for the Reinvent 311 Mobile Content Challenge, please complete a [**short application form**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&formkey=dFJNeHFHYlRRaThGTkkwYXdtenppZEE6MA#gid=0).  We will notify all selected participants by email.  \\r\

This all-day event will feature an morning session with a set of talks introducing GDELT, followed by an afternoon hackathon where the technical and non-technical alike can come together and explore how GDELT can be used to measure, model, visualize, and forecast global human society in powerful new ways. \\r\
\\r\
The Global Database Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world over the last quarter-century down to the city level globally, to make all of this data freely available for open research, and to provide daily updates to create the first \\"realtime social sciences earth observatory.\\" \\r\
\\r\
Nearly a quarter-billion georeferenced events capture global behavior in more than 300 categories covering 1979 to present with daily updates. The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) expands GDELT\'s ability to quantify global human society beyond cataloging physical occurrences towards actually representing all of the latent dimensions, geography, and network structure of the global news. It attempts to connect every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event appearing in the global news into a single massive network that captures what\'s happening around the world, what its context is and who\'s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.\\r\
\\r\
This event is being held in the conference room of the Gallup Building at 901 F St NW (See on Google Maps at: http://goo.gl/maps/88Crp ). The entrance is on 9th street halfway between F and G streets right across the street from the National Portrait Gallery. It is halfway between the Metro Center and Gallery Place Metro stations and easily accessible from a number of other Metro stations.","external_url":"http://gdelt.utdallas.edu","state":"complete","start_time":"2013-12-18T14:00:00Z","end_time":"2013-12-18T22:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/5289706504f082bc5d00003a/original.png?1384738914","students_only":false,"total_hackers":32,"total_hacks":4,"location":{"city":"Washington","state":"DC","country":"USA"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/gdelt-dc-hackathon"},{"id":"529f122d6c196776c0000012","name":"Tucapps Hackathon Ciudadano","slug":"tucapps-hackathon-ciudadano","description":"El Objetivo:\\r\

[itvt], producer of the TV of Tomorrow Show (TVOT) conference series, is pleased to announce the TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon, an event that brings together hackers and creatives to envision and build the TV of Tomorrow.\\r\
\\r\
What is the TV of Tomorrow? As with our last Hackathon event (video recap), we\'ll leave that entirely up to your vision and creativity! However, it could encompass such platforms, technologies and user experiences as the second screen (smartphones, tablets, etc.), game consoles, next-generation cable set-top boxes, smart TV\'s, gestural control, voice control, automatic content recognition, augmented reality, rich interactivity, binge-viewing, big data, metadata, gamification, personalization, audience participation, social media integration, geolocation, transmedia storytelling, and more.\\r\
\\r\
* * *\\r\
\\r\
When: The TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon will take place 12:00PM, December 10th-12:00PM December 11th (Tuesday-Wednesday).\\r\
\\r\
The finalists will then be showcased and the winner selected December 11th in a special session at our East Coast TV of Tomorrow Show event, TVOT NYC 2013, a gathering that attracts many of the leading lights of the advanced-TV industry.\\r\
\\r\
Where: The TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon will take place at 450 W. 31st Street in Manhattan. Check-in to get your badge is on the 10th Floor.\\r\
\\r\
How to Register: Registration is free, but spaces are limited. So register here soon to reserve your place. Please note that registered TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon participants also qualify for discount admission to TVOT NYC 2013. Email swedlow@itvt.com for more information.\\r\
\\r\
The Challenge: Hackers will be challenged to envision the TV of Tomorrow by conceiving, designing and building TV/video apps and experiences, primarily--though not exclusively--using technologies, platforms, content and knowledge contributed by the Hackathon sponsors. Participants are free to implement their visions of the TV of Tomorrow however they wish. While they will receive points for every participating company\'s technology that they employ, they will be judged primarily on the originality, elegance and usefulness (viability, scalability, monetizability etc.) of the app or experience they create.  \\r\
\\r\
Who Should Participate?: The TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon is open to \\"hackers\\" of all kinds, including coders, but also front-end and motion-graphic designers, content visionaries, business visionaries, students, storytellers, filmmakers and others.\\r\
\\r\
What to Expect: The TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon will last 29 hours, and food and drink will be provided. Representatives from the Hackathon sponsors will be on hand to share advice on using their platforms, API\'s and other technologies. In addition, you\'ll be able to participate in breakout sessions with other advanced-/interactive-/social-/multiplatform-TV experts/mentors who can provide you with guidance and inspiration. Once you have completed a prototype or real implementation of your project, you will be asked to pitch it to a panel of judges who will select the three finalist projects that will be showcased at TVOT NYC 2013. The winner, finalists and runners-up will also be featured in a special issue of the [itvt] newsletter, the first, best and most widely read publication on the interactive-TV industry.\\r\
\\r\
What to Bring:\\r\
\\r\
- Your laptop and cables.\\r\
\\r\
- The hardware platform(s) you are developing for, such as tablets, smartphones, NFC chips, Google TV, Apple TV, Roku, etc.\\r\
\\r\
- Cameras, microphones and any other equipment you think you will need, if you are planning to create original video content on-site for your app (however, we will have video assets available, if you would prefer to use them).\\r\
\\r\
- Any software and apps you need in order to create your app or front-end design.\\r\
\\r\
- If you are already planning out your app in advance of the Hackathon, any additional assets you need in order to implement it (video, audio, images, vector art, wireframes, mockups, etc.)..\\r\
\\r\
- Anything else you need for a marathon of creativity and innovation!\\r\
\\r\
Prizes: The winner of the TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon will receive a $6,000 Grand Prize, presented by Comcast. Finalists and runners-up will also be awarded prizes and schwag.\\r\
\\r\
I Just Want to Hang Out and Watch--Can I?: We expect that the TVOT NYC 2013 Hackathon will be a highly enjoyable and very social event, and that it will present great opportunities for schmoozing and networking. However, because space at 450 W. 31st Street is limited, non-\\"hackers\\" will only be admitted if they are TVOT NYC 2013 ticket holders or speakers. Sorry, no exceptions! If you have not yet purchased your TVOT NYC 2013 tickets, you can do so here.\\r\
\\r\
Can My Company Participate as a Hackathon Host or Sponsor?: Yes, though time is running out!

Directions\\r\
\\r\
* From the York Street F stop:\\r\
Exit station and turn right to walk down hill\\r\
Walk down 1 full block to Front St.\\r\
Turn left on Front street\\r\
Walk 3 blocks and turn right on Washington (At Peas & Pickles market)\\r\
Address is 55 Washington St. (walk up the metal ramp to get to front door)\\r\
\\r\
* From the High Street A/C stop:\\r\
This is a long station so you will exit on one of two ends. a) If you exit toward the back of the train (coming from Manhattan) you will come out of the subway across from a small park b) If you exit toward the front of the train (coming from Manhattan) you will come out looking at the access ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.\\r\
\\r\
If \\"a\\" then cross the street and walk through the park and take a left on Cadman Plaza East - walk down the hill (past the pedestrian staircase the Brooklyn Bridge) three blocks to the intersection of Front and Washington (At Peas & Pickles market)\\r\
\\r\
If \\"b\\" then follow the road around to the left when you exit onto Red Cross Place. Follow that about 100 yards until you are on Cadman Plaza E and follow it down the hill (past the pedestrian staircase the Brooklyn Bridge) three blocks to the intersection of Front and Washington (At Peas & Pickles market)\\r\

Location has become one of the fundamental layers of the web. We\'re using location for tracking where we move, to explore new cities, tagging our tweets, status updates, photos and videos. We can add location to every move we do on the web, and we\'re already doing it.\\r\
\\r\
These are exciting times for location based services, and it\'s exciting times for anyone interested in it. We want to give you a day filled with inspiration and knowledge about location; where we are now, where we might be heading and how this will affect everyone. \\r\
\\r\
We\'ll have entrepreneurs talking about how they\'re using location in their products and services and we\'re bringing you some of the most knowledgeable people on the topics location + quantified self / exploration / service layer / city planning. \\r\
\\r\
So basically, clear your calendar on the 6th and 7th of December and make sure to come to Malm\\u00f6. The day will continue into a night of hacking, where the theme is... location of course. More details to be announced, but one thing is sure - you don\'t want to miss this.\\r\

# Location Day 24h Hackathon \\r\
18.00 Friday - 18.00 Saturday. Yep, that\\u2019s 24 hours. You can sleep, or you can stay up all night and hack.\\r\
\\r\
## Friday\\r\
18.00: Welcome & gather / Create Teams\\r\
18.10: Presenting Teams \\r\
18.20: Presenting APIs\\r\
18.30: Tunaspot, lessons learned \\r\
18.40: Kickstart Hack\\r\
\\u2026 hack all night all day \\u2026 \\r\
\\r\
## Saturday\\r\
18.00: Hands off the keyboard\\r\
18.01: Breath & Relax\\r\
18.30: Hack Demo Time\\r\
19.00: Keynote\\r\
19.15: Award Ceremony\\r\
19.30: Drinks!\\r\
\\r\
## The plan\\r\
The plan is to start at 18.00 on Friday night, after the conference is over and the inspiration is exploding, the hands are dying to get moving over the keyboards and the brain is loaded with ideas of how to build the next cool location thing. \\r\
\\r\
## Teams\\r\
We\\u2019ll start by gathering and really short presenting the teams. You can come with an already existing team or you can create on the spot, and join others.\\r\
\\r\
## APIs \\r\
There will be API-owners at place and after the team presentation we\\u2019ll let the owners quickly show off their APIs. One of the owners and sponsor, PingPal, will release their location API for this hack! \\r\
\\r\
## Rules\\r\
There\\u2019s no rules really. It\\u2019s a friendly competition with the theme location but apart from that you\\u2019re free to do whatever you want. Give it all, and you\\u2019ll have a great time!\\r\
\\r\
## Presentation\\r\
Ok, so there is a few rules. No Keynotes or Powerpoints as presentations. It\\u2019s a hack, and as such, the hack should be demoable. To make it smooth for the film team and to get a good flow at the demo time, it\\u2019s required* to have a URL ready to show in a browser.\\r\
Sign up your teams, team members & demo URLs in this very basic Google Spreadsheet http://cl.ly/2p0o1C3W0j33\\r\
\\r\
* if you\\u2019re building something that\\u2019s not demoable in a MacBook* web browser let us know beforehand so we can prepare the film crew and make sure it\\u2019s smooth. \\r\
\\r\
So, that\\u2019s as specific information as there is right now. \\r\

[OpenJDK hackaton](http://2013.java2days.com/?p=392 \\"OpenJDK hackaton\\")\\r\
\\r\
Training\\r\
========\\r\
\\r\
During the conference there will be two technical sessions (one in the first day and another one - in the second day) that will cover the details around the Adopt OpenJDK initiative and the internals of the Hotspot JVM. \\r\
Another two sessions will be held during the hands-on labs covering modification of JDK source code, writing JTReg tests and working with lambdas.\\r\
\\r\
Hackdays\\r\
========\\r\
\\r\
During the two days of the hackaton each participant may contribute patches/documentation/ideas for different categories. For each of the categories there will be a set of guidelines provided by the organizers used to aid participants. The categories are as follows:\\r\
\\r\
+ beginner level:\\r\
   - fix warnings\\r\
   - fix small bugs\\r\
   - reverse engineer part of a project and create document or presentation that describes it \\r\
+ intermediate level:\\r\
   - extend a project with sample new feature\\r\
   - provide tests for feature(s) in a specific project\\r\
   - fix moderate level bugs\\r\
+ advanced level:\\r\
   - tune performance of a feature in a project\\r\
   - fix hard bugs\\r\
   - create a customized version of the JVM\\r\
   - provide ideas for new algorithms and collections to the core JDK libraries\\r\
   - provide ideas for new JSRs and projects in the ecosystem \\r\
\\r\
A typical flow for any of the above activities is as follows:\\r\
\\r\
+ a participants selects an activity and starts working (source patches in the form of diff files are submitted to ReviewBoard for codereview, ideas are being outlined in a shared document/presentation and documentation is outlined in a shared document)\\r\
\\r\
+ if a participant has difficulty with any of the activities he may ask a mentor or other participant for help (via the IRC channel, the shared whiteboard or the shared source code editor depending on the type of activity)\\r\
\\r\
+ mentors should review all of the submitted items (documents/presentations/patches) and store them in the shared storage space after being finalized.\\r\
\\r\
At the end of the second hackday results are announced and participants are awarded.\\r\

\\r\
How can you use digital technology to develop an application that transforms education? For inspiration, we\'ve provided a few example ideas that might get you thinking about the possibilities of what you could build:\\r\
\\r\
* **Mobile Applications:** Build a tablet or phone application for students, teachers, administrators, or learners of all ages. \\r\
* **Time-saving tools:** Both students and teachers are pressed for time. Can you build an application that allows teachers or students to be more efficient, or to learn or complete tasks outside of the physical or virtual classroom?\\r\
* **Learning & Retention:** Can you build an immersive, fun, collaborative experience to engage students, promote learning and retention, personalize education, or promote social learning?\\r\
* **Utilizing Technology:** What non-traditional educational technologies might you integrate with an on-line learning experience? Would you use your X-Box to submit a homework assignment?\\r\
\\r\

Dates: This weekend!\\r\
\\r\
You are invited to the next hackathon from the Highground Hackers! This event is focused on Mental Health issues - finding creative solutions from the most creative minds in the Bay Area - yours!\\r\
\\r\
As with all of our hackathons, we take challenging issues and provide you with experts in the field to tackle them.  For this challenge, the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), the leading academic institution on holistic Mental Health, will be on the ground as mentors, educators, and consultants to you as you build your solutions.\\r\
\\r\
Hack for Good and Win CASH - $1,500!!\\r\
\\r\
Our friends at the Technology Credit Union have generously sponsored a cash prize for the winning application developed.  $1,500 for the winning hacker or team of hackers!!\\r\
\\r\
Bring your own project, or work directly with researchers, lecturers, and other experts to create real solutions to important issues.  This is all brought to bare to enable you to build the most effective apps possible in what promises to be an exciting weekend.\\r\
\\r\
The event is sponsored by Accenture and will be held at the Rackspace co-working space Geekdom, food and drinks will be provided.  You\'ll have power, wi-fi, and a great place to meet other hackers and build cool stuff.\\r\
\\r\
To provide you with some background, CIIS have broken down the field into specific problem statements below.  Leading up to the event, we will be adding introductory videos, the first of which are linked to below.\\r\
\\r\
Sign Up Here: http://highgroundhackers.eventbrite.com/\\r\
\\r\
As with our previous hackathon (targeted at reducing gun violence) you will have access to experts in the field of Mental Health. Bring your own project, or work with researchers, lecturers, and other experts in Mental Health from the California Institute of Integral Studies to create real solutions to important issues.\\r\
\\r\
Sponsored by Accenture and held at the Rackspace co-working space Geekdom, food and drinks will be provided.  You\'ll have power, wi-fi, and a great place to meet other hackers and build cool stuff.\\r\
\\r\
There will also be inspirational talks at the event for a quick break from the keyboard (see below....it\'s pretty cool!).\\r\
\\r\
Example Problem Statements\\r\
\\r\
Here is a short list of the types of problems within the field of Mental Health where software engineering and social hacks can really help.  At the event will be a specialist in each of these fields.  They will go into detail about the challenges, the data, and help brainstorm with you on potential solutions.\\r\
\\r\
>> Suicide\\r\
\\r\
In many instances a suicide attempt is a call for help.  We need mechanisms for immediate and human-powered crisis intervention.\\r\
\\r\
>> Mental Health Assessment\\r\
\\r\
Children and adults who are in crisis need to be identified in order to be supported with help and services. Those who are un-identified risk falling through the cracks.\\r\
\\r\
>> Trauma Response\\r\
\\r\
People who have experienced trauma tend to be hyper-alert of a repeat performance and create stories around an issue or person, hurting any chance of healing or release, and causing violent outbursts.\\r\
\\r\
>> Domestic Violence\\r\
\\r\
In some people anxiety can provoke an aggressive and violent response. Aggression and violence may not be \\"common\\" in those with anxiety, but they\'re very real and can be extremely problematic for those that suffer from them.\\r\
\\r\
>> Isolation\\r\
\\r\
When a person is emotionally isolated, they keep their feelings completely to themselves, are unable to receive emotional support from others, \\u201cshut down\\u201d or feel numb, and cannot or do not communicate with others. Breaking a cycle of isolation is a difficult but necessary part of recovery from emotional distress.\\r\
\\r\
>> Inner Critic/Super Ego\\r\
\\r\
Super Egos are powered by aggression and can cause depression, low self-esteem, self-justified blaming that can lead to violence, isolation issues, narcissism and racism.\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
Inspirational Talks\\r\
\\r\
Merlin\\u2019s New iPhone: New Inventions Meet Old Tales\\r\
Craig Chalquist, Ph.D.\\r\
Department Chair, East-West Psychology\\r\
California Institute of Integral Studies\\r\
\\r\
A new device doesn\\u2019t drop into the world entirely premade, but packed with ancient images, stories, and bits of lore. Attend this presentation to hear some parallels between the technologies of today and the ancient myths that foreshadowed them. Consciousness of the fantasies that cling to our machines could make the difference between owning and being owned by them, loss of human potential and its amplification into possibilities for a bright new future.\\r\
\\r\
Craig Chalquist, PhD is department chair of East-West Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies. A lecturer and graduate instructor, he has also written several books on the intersections between mind, myth, culture, and world.\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
Human Flourishing\\r\
Meg Jordan, PhD, RN, CWP\\r\
Department Chair, Integrative Health Studies\\r\
California Institute of Integral Studies\\r\
\\r\
An inescapable paradox of the 21st century is that the faster we go, the more we rely on presence as the quality that gets us by. Yet how do you cultivate crazy-slow wisdom in an accelerated era? Can the pressure for higher performance and productivity co-exist with the essential human desires for happiness, contentment and social belonging? This presentation on Human Flourishing will explore the relationship between mental activity and physiological responses, and review recent neuroscientific findings that prove the power of positivity.\\r\

The objective of the Mental Health Hackathon is to devise creative technology solutions to problems related to mental health across different demographics and populations.\\r\
\\r\
We aim to bring together over 200 developers and experts in the field of mental health and those communities that work with those suffering from mental health issues.\\r\
\\r\
From this effort, we expect to generate and create over 30 different applications that can be used to address different challenges related to mental health.\\r\
\\r\
Working with investors, incubators, sponsors, and users (organizations) of the applications, we plan to nurture the results of the hackathon and to deliver as many of them to the market as possible.\\r\

### Opening Keynotes\\r\
\\r\
Join Facebook and Parse for Mobile Developer Day on November 14th at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California. We\'ll open the day with the keynote, \\"Make it Sing: Designing for Mobile at Rdio\\" from Jason Russell, Product Manager for Rdio, the wildly successful mobile app. We know you\'ll get great inspiration for your own projects from this seasoned developer\'s experiences.\\r\
\\r\
### Build with Parse\\r\
\\r\
Stop building apps the hard way. In our Parse-focused session, we\'ll show you how to build a full-featured native app, starting with the very first step of signing up for an account. We\'ll cover data sharing, basic login, social login with Twitter and Facebook, push notifications, and more so you can dive into the afternoon hackathon ready to build.\\r\
\\r\
### Grow with Facebook\\r\
\\r\
You\'ve built a beautiful, full-featured app with Parse, now how do you grow a user base? Increase traffic to your app using Facebook\'s mobile app install ads, a proven way to reach a more relevant audience and efficiently drive installs, and by driving word of mouth through integration of our Share Dialogs and Open Graph to help get your mobile app discovered.\\r\
\\r\
### Hackathon\\r\
\\r\
After morning sessions on optimizing your app development process with Parse and Facebook, we\'ll put your newfound skills to work with a mini-hackathon. Teams of 4 will create apps with Parse and Facebook and an all-star panel will award prizes to the top 3 apps developed during the hackathon.\\r\
\\r\
### Who Should Attend\\r\

MapAction wants to use what you build.\\r\
\\r\
Work alone or work in a group, but either way each team will present what they create, and an expert panel will select the winners of awesome prizes. It\'s The Real Deal.\\r\
\\r\
##Why?\\r\
\\r\
In the aftermath of a disaster thousands of people can suddenly find themselves battling to save lives and livelihoods. Before aid agencies can help them, the first requirement is information. Which areas have yet to be reached? Where are the relief resources? Where are the people in greatest need?\\r\
\\r\
Join the Esri UK and MapAction Hackathon and accept the challenge to build an App that MapAction can deploy at the right time and in the right place, in the field or in day-to-day operations. Work with your favourite ArcGIS tools and programming languages to make a difference.  \\r\
\\r\
##The Problems\\r\
\\r\
24 hours before the hackathon, [on this page](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/esri-uk-and-mapaction-hackathon/wikipages/526ae172cd891018cb000004) we will publish the 8-10 problems at hand. From there you can choose to improve an app or build something new. Teams will also be given software, services, and tech support on-site to help along the way.\\r\

Portland State University and the Technology Association of Oregon will host the first CleanWeb Hack and will bring together college students, industry innovators, entrepreneurs, and civic leadership to illuminate the opportunities for creating new efficiencies in energy, buildings, waste and water. The event will bring together talent and technology resources to explore the intersection of information technology (web, social, mobile) and issues related to climate change and global resource constraints.\\r\
\\r\
The PSU-TAO CleanWeb Hack is a part of a joint summit between PSU and TAO titled, Portland State of Mind: Powering the Region\\u2019s Tech Economy. PSU will host a summit for strategic partners in the region\\u2019s technology sector. This event will focus on industry needs and PSU\\u2019s role in supporting them --from R&D to workforce training to economic development.  The CleanWeb Hack will be marketed to Portland\\u2019s technology community as the final day of this three-day tech summit, and the CleanWeb Hack will serve as an opportunity to put principle into practice by fostering innovation and collaboration among students, tech professionals, and academics.  \\r\
\\r\
TAO and PSU are bringing Stephen Fleming, the Head of Georgia Tech\\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute, to Portland to help lead these discussions.  The goal by the end of the summit is to have a number of models that can be applied across Oregon\\u2019s university system to break down barriers between industry and academia.  The CleanWeb Hack represents the first of what will likely be a regular series of collaborative efforts between the tech industry and academia in Oregon.   \\r\
\\r\
The CleanWeb Hack will bring together students and professors from different disciplines to solve environmental issues through utilization of information technology. This is also a \\"tech laboratory\\u201d where students will work alongside professionals to apply their knowledge.

====================================\\r\
\\r\
https://digitaldisruptionhackathon.eventbrite.com\\r\
\\r\
Where serious mash-ups meet new and creative end-to-end management\\r\
------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\
\\r\
Do you have an app that is missing some pieces and you want to interface with partners to get them?  Do you have an app that\\u2019s a great idea but it\\u2019s going to need 24/7 monitoring and management to ever be real?  Do you want to learn how to use communications services to improve your apps? \\r\
\\r\
This hackathon, produced by TM Forum, is exploring a new set of APIs and new concepts for how apps will be created and managed, so it is about learning as much as it is about hacking.  We will have expert mentors and code examples, so you can Hack and Learn together.\\r\
We\\u2019ve teamed with Apigee to build a platform where you can mash up products out of functions exposed by other companies using open APIs.  So not only can you develop apps much faster using that are already built, but you can assemble them in your own unique, creative way - from a taxi broker to eHealth remote patient monitoring and everything in between.  Also key for these kinds of apps is monitoring and management 24x7 across the end-to-end service. We\\u2019ve got that covered with our APIs, too. \\r\
\\r\
Lead developers of these APIs will be on hand to help you succeed: you\'ll work with teams of engineers from companies like Cisco, Ericsson and Orange.  But we\'ll also listen to you, telling us what works and what does not.\\r\
And let\\u2019s not forget the prizes: up to $6,000 in cold, hard cash.\\r\
\\r\
What We Bring\\r\
-------------\\r\
Short presentations and code samples to help bootstrap your hacking, round the clock technical advice, food to keep you going, and caffeine to keep you awake.  And of course our APIs:\\r\
* Trouble Ticketing\\r\
* Product Catalog\\r\
* Partner Ordering\\r\
* Simple Management\\r\
* Consoles for all APIs\\r\
\\r\
All participants will receive a free one-day Silver Pass to Digital Disruption 2013.\\r\
\\r\
What You Bring\\r\
--------------\\r\
Your knowledge of REST, your desire to learn and your desire to hang out with and team up with creative developers for the weekend.\\r\
\\r\
Speakers you will meet:\\r\
\\r\
* Pierre Gauthier, Java Star Spec Lead and Digital Service Management Chief API Architect at TM Forum\\r\
* Michel Burger, Lead Architect at Apigee, formerly Chief Architect R&D at Vodafone and CTO for Communications Sector at Microsoft\\r\
* Ryan Leckey, Maintainer of Black Duck 2012 Open Source Rookie of the Year project, Chaplin.js and CTO at Concordus Applications\\r\
\\r\
$6000 in Prizes\\r\
---------------\\r\
Grand Prize: $3,000, plus all members of the winning team will receive non-transferrable gold tickets to Digital Disruption 2013 for he best overall usage of one or more of the new TM Forum APIs.\\r\
\\r\
Best Usage of Trouble Ticket API: $1,000\\r\
\\r\
Best Usage of Product Catalog API: $1,000\\r\
\\r\
Best Usage of Product Ordering API: $1,000\\r\
\\r\
If you read between the lines, you see that your team could win all prizes, which total $6,000 cash \\u2013 no gift cards, tablets or travel. Just cold, hard cash for your team.\\r\
 \\r\
Judges\\r\
------\\r\
Judges will look at creative and effective use of the management APIs. You must use at least one of the management APIs to be eligible to win. Final pitches will demonstrate efficacy, and judges will have time for Q+A.\\r\

APIs\\r\
----\\r\
Our APIs come from our years of experience in management and were designed and created by experts (our TM Forum members) who have spent their whole careers thinking about this stuff.  They took their expertise and packaged it into a set of REST APIs to change the way management happens.\\r\
\\r\
* Trouble Ticketing API:  When something fails anywhere in the value chain, get help fast.\\r\
API Functions: Create trouble tickets, alert problem owners, resolve problems interactively\\r\
The Vision:  What if you could get trouble tickets as Tweets? \\r\
\\r\
* Product Catalog API: Find and share functional components with partners in the value chain to create new services seamlessly.\\r\
API Functions: Share product and pricing information from your catalog; seek products and services from other catalog owners; create product bundles\\r\
The Vision:  Imagine if you could create new products in 3 clicks?\\r\
\\r\
* Partner Ordering API: This is the heart of product mash-ups. Turn product catalog items into your latest business venture by ordering them from their owners and mashing them into your hot new offering.  Conversely, you can sell something to your partners, too!\\r\
API Functions: Place orders, take orders, track progress\\r\
The Vision: Imagine if time to market from concept to fruition was under an hour?\\r\
\\r\
* Simple Management API: Like the name says, this one makes it simple to see the health of an app.  Is it working? Is anything broken? \\r\
API Functions: Report on app status; report failures; register for notification of changes; collect measurements; register for notification of status changes;\\r\
The Vision: 10 partners, one view of a service health.  How cool would that be?\\r\
\\r\
What kinds of services might you hack?\\r\
There is a class of services out there that need managing \\u2013 and by managing we mean full time babysitting.  You absolutely must know if they are working right, how they are performing and if they are doing what they are designed to do 24x7.   And doing that is hard enough when you are just minding your own services, but imagine if you add partners in the mix and if you are relying on a service provider or other company to provide you critical capabilities.  You need to know that you can see end-to-end what is happening at all times.  No excuses allowed.\\r\
* You can run a startup by building the apps supporting these open APIs for large service providers\\r\
* You can use the APIs to build applications that you resell to other service providers\\r\
* You can build mobile apps that use these APIs\\r\
\\r\
And\\u2026.\\r\
* Use the TM Forum APIs to access and benefit from Service Provider Digital Services Offerings available today and mash them up to provide robust applications in eHealth, Internet of Things, financial services or any other high availability service\\r\
* Develop new apps that act as clients in enriching the Service Provider Web APIs\\r\
* Develop apps implementing the APIs with backend plugged into social networks\\r\
\\r\
The possibilities are endless and they are all based on ubiquitous Web and TM Forum REST APIs.\\r\

\\r\
HackFest is an extended form of a hackathon that runs across three work-days. \\r\
\\r\
An overnight hackathon could perhaps keep you less distracted and offer bonus points like the beauty of watching the sun rise, etc ;) However this multi-day version would be way more empowering. You may think of HackFest as a 20% project time opportunity to build anything you want. So we strongly encourage everyone to participate and have a blast out of it. \\r\
\\r\
We kick-off the event by going through the event details, rules and schedule. This will be followed by a lottery activity to form teams. In an attempt to break the routine and facilitate you to work with new buddies, you will not allowed to form your own teams. A lottery will be conducted for it. \\r\
\\r\
There are totally two buckets of participation categories (Developer, Product). Please register yourself for either one or for both the roles of interest. We will (randomly) pick two name-cards from Developer bucket and one from Product bucket to assemble every single team. Once the teams are formed, you are left on your own.

Coming from different fields (such as fashion, design, automotive and payment), the companies will be asked to make some of their assets (not only tech items) available in order to let developers, designers and marketing specialists hack them. During 24 hours of non-stop work they will be collaborating with some of the most relevant international brands with the goal of redesigning their production models through digital tools. \\r\
\\r\
Passion for technology combined to enthusiasm and creativity is the key feature defining our activities and we aim at putting in contact the most traditional companies and business fields with hackers communities, in order to enhance manufacturers of \\"Made in Italy\\" products.\\r\

About NFTE: The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship\'s mission is to provide programs that inspire young people from low-income communities to stay in school, to recognize business opportunities and to plan for successful futures. \\r\
\\r\
About Pilot:  Pilot is a national organization focused on giving students the ability to turn their ideas in real apps and products. We believe that with today\\u2019s resources, no student should feel that they don\\u2019t have the tools to make the products they believe should exist. To accomplish this, we\\u2019re pairing these students up with mentors from the top companies across the US and in their local area. We want to demonstrate how innovative and creative students can be, and how what we are learning today will shape our futures. Pilot events will provide students the opportunity to gain valuable feedback and contact with startup and corporate founders and mentors, show off their skills, and compete.","external_url":"nftepilotsf","state":"complete","start_time":"2013-10-12T16:00:00Z","end_time":"2013-10-13T01:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/5259ca08337a2d3fd9000044/original.png?1381616132","students_only":false,"total_hackers":29,"total_hacks":23,"location":{"city":"Palo Alto","state":"California","country":"United States"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/nfte-pilotsf-high-school-hackathon"},{"id":"5243b992b6cca274af000081","name":"aggieHack(web)","slug":"aggiehack-web","description":"This is a coding event unlike any ever seen at Texas A&M!

Hack4Reno is a weekend hackathon event for building apps that create a more informed and engaged community in the city of Reno.\\r\
\\r\
This means creating apps, websites, and/or platforms that help aggregate, collect or share information about the area. We have partnered with the City of Reno to help them see that we can build a smarter city on top of open data and the importance of opening more, high quality, clean data over time. We will have some city datasets available for the hackathon but teams are encouraged to use any and all data sources they can find.\\r\
\\r\
With Hack4Reno 2011 and 2012, our goal was to showcase the local technology and startup talent that currently exists within the area and that quality work can be created without a multimillion dollar investment, right here in our own backyard. We were successful and we\'re going to do it all again this year!\\r\

#MIT\\u2019s biggest hackathon is back!\\r\
\\r\
At last February\\u2019s HackMIT, over 200 hackers competed for over $5000 in prizes. This time, we\\u2019re going bigger than ever: on October 4-6, over 500 student hackers from all over the world will gather at HackMIT for a hackathon like you\\u2019ve never seen before.\\r\
\\r\
##FAQ\\r\
\\r\
###Who can attend?\\r\
All undergraduate and graduate students from anywhere are welcome!\\r\
\\r\
###How big should teams be? Can I do it alone?\\r\
Teams should be at most 4 people total. You can do it alone, but it\'ll be less fun! We\'ll have a site up to help find teams before the event, and you\'ll have time at the start to meet others.\\r\
\\r\
###What\'s the format of the hackathon?\\r\
Anything goes! Web apps, mobile apps, and hardware hacks are all welcome. (Hacks should be computer-related, though.) Projects will be judged based on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness.\\r\
\\r\
###I\'m not too close to MIT. Can I get reimbursed for travel?\\r\
We\'re working out travel reimbursement details right now. Please check back closer to the event.\\r\
\\r\
###Are we allowed to build on past projects? Other code?\\r\
We strongly discourage building off of existing projects you\'ve worked on. To be fair to others, let us know if you are using some of your old code in your hacks. Using third-party APIs and libraries is definitely okay, as long as they\'re accessible by everyone else as well.\\r\
\\r\
###I have a question that\'s not listed here. Who should I ask?\\r\
You can get in touch with us via [email](mailto:hackmit@mit.edu), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hackmit), or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/hackmit).","external_url":"hackmit.org","state":"complete","start_time":"2013-10-05T03:00:00Z","end_time":"2013-10-06T15:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/51b9fe9a1a8a33d47c00000f/original.png?1371143830","students_only":true,"total_hackers":51,"total_hacks":0,"location":{"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"USA"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackmit-1"},{"id":"521d20ff9bc5079217000027","name":"WAN-IFRA Media Hack Day","slug":"wan-ifra-media-hack-day","description":"The world of news publishing is changing fast.

Over the Air is an event that defies easy description. It\\u2019s a celebration of creativity. It\\u2019s a festival of all things mobile. It\\u2019s a place where attendees can learn about technologies, trends and techniques. It\\u2019s a sleep-over. It\\u2019s a two day party. It\\u2019s an event where practitioners of creative and technical disciplines can come together to learn from each other. It\\u2019s about recognizing software development as a creative discipline. It\\u2019s an opportunity to build new relationships. It\\u2019s a space where you can build cool stuff and show it off to an appreciative crowd. It\\u2019s all these things. And by the way, it\\u2019s free.\\r\
\\r\
We promise the following: if you attend, you will learn about stuff you didn\\u2019t know about before, will have the opportunity to meetand collaborate with people you haven\\u2019t met before, will be inspired, and possibly amazed.

Jointly with our sponsor [Zvooq.ru](http://zvooq.ru/), a service by [Dream Industries](http://dreamindustries.co/), we will organize a co-located event RuSSIR Music Hackathon, a unique place to work together on building a cool prototype (web-, desktop-, mobile apps etc.) from scratch. The Hackathon participants will compete in creating applications to improve user experience in listening music.\\r\
\\r\
The Hackathon is an open event. We believe that the Hackathon will be beneficial for creative people from different areas: RuSSIR school attendants will have a great opportunity to apply their new skills for real-life problems, students and professional developers will be able to switch from day-to-day tasks and bring ingenious ideas to life, designers will get a valuable experience how to compete with each other by making creative works under the fast deadline, and, last but not least, musicians may inspire all other participants and contribute to with fresh insights.\\r\
\\r\
You have never been at hackathons before? Here are some hints on it. The Hackathon will last for 24 hours. Participants will start from pitching ideas and forming teams (up to 8 people) in the first day evening. Then, they can stay up all night long and/or continue hacking the next day until evening. Within the pre-set periods, teams may get help from independent technology experts (coaches). Finally, teams have to present their projects to an audience and the authors of the best projects will be awarded. That\\u2019s it. Cool, huh?  \\r\
\\r\
The two things you need (except a desire to have fun and learn!) are a laptop as well as a photo ID.\\r\
\\r\
As organizers, we will supply the food, prizes, Internet connection, and related data sets/APIs.\\r\

Skoltech first hackathon \\u201cThe Cube\\u201d is different. The event will be organized in teams as a brainstorming session among not only IT guys, but all Skoltech students, faculty, and staff who would like to participate. The topic will be about improving Hypercube. After the session, every team will present to a committee of Judges a proposal to improve Hypercube in some way and tell about resources, timeframe, and team needed for implementation. The best proposals will get funding (if needed) and will start implementing their projects.\\r\

###Agenda###\\r\
There are two parts to the Disrupt Hackathon:\\r\
\\r\
* **The Hacking**, where over 800 hackers will build something awesome from scratch between 12:30pm Saturday to 9:30am Sunday. \\r\
* **The Demoing**, where the hacks will be demoed before judges, the media, other hackers and the public.\\r\
\\r\
###The Hacking###\\r\
Hackers will build something awesome from scratch, either individually or in teams. \\r\
\\r\
Since you\'re short on time and the aim is to impress the judges and win some of the awesome prizes on offer, you\'re encouraged to make heavy use of [APIs and resources](/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2013/wikipages/520517c876ab293895000028) (see the links on the left). We\'ll also have a series of [API workshops on Saturday afternoon](/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2013/wikipages/5205177676ab293895000027) with experts on hand to answer your questions and keep you hacking, not scratching your head.\\r\
\\r\
Each Hack will need to be registered on our platform as a Project; you and your team-mates will also need to register as users on our platform (powered by [HackerLeague](https://www.hackerleague.org)).\\r\
\\r\
*Creating (and later submitting) your project is the only way you\'ll be able to get to demo your hack (and win prizes and free tickets to Disrupt) on Sunday*.\\r\
\\r\
###The Demoing###\\r\
You\'ll have until 9:30am on Sunday, September 8th submit your project/hack. When you submit your hack, you\'ll be given a number which is the order in which you\'ll present your hack.\\r\
\\r\
At 11:00am, presentations will begin in the main hall.  You will bring your device onto the stage, and have 1 minute to demo your hack.  If you take longer than one minute, you will be publicly embarrassed.  \\r\
\\r\
Three hacks will be selected by the judges for demoing during this week\'s Disrupt conference.\\r\
\\r\
One hack will be awarded $5k for the Best Hack of the event.\\r\
\\r\
Each team that demos their Hack on stage on Sunday will be eligible for two tickets to the main Disrupt conference, valued at almost $3000 each.","external_url":"http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-hackathon-2013/","state":"complete","start_time":"2013-09-07T19:30:00Z","end_time":"2013-09-08T16:50:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/520516ff76ab293895000023/original.jpg?1376065272","students_only":false,"total_hackers":610,"total_hacks":260,"location":{"city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","country":"USA"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2013"},{"id":"5213867aad2cf28481000020","name":"Dressed to Code: Glamour\'s Fashion Hackathon","slug":"dressed-to-code-glamours-fashion-hackathon","description":"Dressed to Code: Glamour\'s Fashion Hackathon\\r\

August 2013 im Waldhofbad in Wernigerode einfinden. Denn hier veranstaltet die Hochschule Harz in Zusammenarbeit mit der Stadt Wernigerode ein Stelldichein zwischen jungen, kreativen K\\u00f6pfen und namhaften Experten der IT-Branche. \\r\
\\r\
Das Mammutprojekt wurde auf den Titel \\u201e48h Codecamp\\u201c getauft und der Name ist hier wortw\\u00f6rtlich Programm. Die Herausforderung besteht darin, innerhalb von zwei Tagen einen vorzeigbaren Prototypen zu entwerfen. Dazu k\\u00f6nnen sich Teams bilden,, die sich auf eine Idee einigen um sie im Anschluss mit den Technologien unserer Partner in die Realit\\u00e4t umsetzen. F\\u00fcr die Hersteller ist dies eine ideale Gelegenheit, ihre Produkte im Feldeinsatz zu testen, wo hingegen alle Interessierten die Gelegenheit bekommen, barrierefrei nach Herzenslust zu programmieren. Hier gibt es die M\\u00f6glichkeit, aktuelle Softwareneuheiten auszuprobieren, die sonst nur professionellen Entwicklern vorbehalten ist. Die ungezwungene Atmosph\\u00e4re macht es zudem m\\u00f6glich, mit den Unternehmen in Kontakt zu treten und sich somit f\\u00fcr ein weiteres Zusammenarbeiten zu empfehlen. \\r\
\\r\
Abgerundet wird das Rahmenprogramm durch Pr\\u00e4sentationen von Experten, die ihre reichhaltigen Erfahrungen mit den Teilnehmern teilen. Diese \\u201eTechTalks\\u201c finden in abgetrennten Bereichen des Waldhofbades statt und auch abseits davon stehen die Referenten mit ihrem umfangreichen Wissensschatz zur Verf\\u00fcgung. Aber nicht nur aus diesem Pool l\\u00e4sst sich sch\\u00f6pfen. Sollte man sich nach intensiven Arbeitsphasen etwas \\u201eausgebrannt\\u201c f\\u00fchlen , empfiehlt sich ein Sprung in die Fluten oder ein Sonnenbad um den geistigen Akku wieder aufzuladen. Die Schwimmbecken sind f\\u00fcr die G\\u00e4ste immer \\u201eOpen Source\\u201c und bieten zusammen mit anderen Aktivit\\u00e4ten eine willkommene Abwechslung zum Programmieralltag. Das vorrangige Ziel der Veranstaltung liegt darin, den Austausch von Wissen mit einem gewissen Spa\\u00dffaktor zu multiplizieren. \\r\
\\r\
Das Programmieren unter freiem Himmel, die Kontaktaufnahme mit international renommierten Unternehmen und die besondere Location ergeben unterm Strich eine mehr als lohnenswerte Erfahrung f\\u00fcr alle Beteiligten. Damit die Gleichung aufgeht, w\\u00fcrden wir uns freuen, wenn wir Sie als Teilnehmer zum gr\\u00f6\\u00dften Open-Air-Programmiercamp Sachsen-Anhalts begr\\u00fc\\u00dfen d\\u00fcrfen.\\r\

According to the CDC, 1 in 88 children are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), up from 1 in 150 in 2000. That 1 in 150 are now entering the workforce, applying to colleges and trying to find housing just like the rest of us adults, but they have the added challenges that come with having ASD. At this hackathon, the objective will be on solving the big and the day-to-day issues that adults and individuals transitioning from school or services with autism spectrum disorder face. Let\\u2019s come together to create solutions to these challenges!\\r\
Don\\u2019t worry if you don\\u2019t have programming skills!\\r\
The event is open to anyone who wants to be involved! We need subject matter experts, coders, designers, information architects and everyone who wants to use technology to make a difference in the lives of those on the autism spectrum.\\r\
We provide the grub, the snacks and beverages. You provide your talents and technology. We recommend that you bring a laptop if you plan on developing or designing. We will have speakers and a presntation of ideas at the end.\\r\
Prizes will be awarded, but more importantly you\'ll be part of a discussion that could improve the lives of those who are struggling with these issues.\\r\
Partners and speakers will be announced as we get close to the date of the evet.\\r\
Themes for the Hack\\r\
1. Employment - Employers need to know the accomodations that they should make for those with autism and the employee needs to kow how to clearly communcate those needs. It could be something that the person could reference for tips on how to behave in an office. It could be a tracking app for the job coach. It could even be a service that helped to craft a form letter with accomodations in it that was a clear and appropriate business communication.\\r\
2. Post Secondary Education - It\'s hard to ask for help and many people with autism in school just don\'t ask for the accomodations that they need to flourish in the classroom to avoid the social situation of approsching the professor. Professors need to be made aware in a clear, and comfortable to the student, way of what those needs are. This could cover tips for new social situations on campus like working in groups or getting help at the library. \\r\
3. Dating/Relationships - This would address  sexuality issues, and a lot of adults with ASD don\\u2019t feel they understand what is expected of them on a date, what they should do and talk about, what is ok and what is inappropriate, how they should ask for what they want, and how to behave. Many people with ASD also have repetitve behavoirs or trouble maintaining eye contact and this can be off putting to those who might not understand it at the beginning. What is the best way to communicate that on a first date? \\r\
4. Roommates - Can you help connect adults with ASD to other adults w/ASD looking for compatible roommates (location, personality, support needs and financial necessities, etc.) \\r\
5. Appropriate Behavoirs - Many people with ASD have trouble monitoring how loud they are, where they are in space, how close they are to other people and they often times use repetitive behavoirs called \\"stimming\\" to help them remain calm especially in stressful stiuations. \\r\

\\r\
THE CHALLENGE:\\r\
==========\\r\
\\r\
Create a White Board Meeting Notes App\\r\
---------------------------------- \\r\
\\r\
We\\u2019ve all been in meetings where lots of great information is written on the whiteboard.  In the olden days, someone would write it all down or type it into their laptop while sitting in the conference room.  That evolved into taking pictures of the whiteboard and transcribing it later.   What if we could take a picture of the whiteboard, incorporate other meeting notes and blast it out to all of the meeting participants?   \\r\
\\r\
That\\u2019s your challenge: Create a Sencha Touch-based whiteboard meeting notes app that runs on multiple mobile platforms, including BlackBerry 10.  We\\u2019ve listed some \\u201cmust have\\u201d requirements below, but you should feel free to add your own creative flair to it!\\r\
\\r\
REQUIREMENTS\\r\
=========\\r\
\\r\
* Must be built with Sencha Touch\\r\
* Must work and look awesome on a BlackBerry 10 device\\r\
* Must be able to take photos of the whiteboard* \\r\
* Must be able to add notes or metadata\\r\
* You should be able to highlight, colorize and/or hide parts of the whiteboard\\r\
* You need to be able to track meeting participants\\r\

## Mission: ##\\r\
 We believe that there\'s no better way to learn something than hanging out with people who are doing it for fun, and we think one of the Internet\'s untapped potentials is to include people everywhere in the world in social communities as wonderful as our own. If we can develop a model workflow by which to run tele-hackathons between the USA and Tanzania, then we believe we can port the model to anywhere.\\r\

\\r\
Der Gesundheitsmarkt befindet sich im Wandel. Auf Grund der sich \\u00e4ndernden demographischen Situation muss sich auch die Herangehensweise an die Themen ver\\u00e4ndern und anpassen. Vor allem im Hinblick auf pr\\u00e4ventive Ma\\u00dfnahmen im betrieblichen Umfeld, einem bisher eher sp\\u00e4rlich bedeckten Themengebiet, gilt es bereits fr\\u00fchzeitig Verhaltensmuster zu erkennen und durch entsprechende Ma\\u00dfnahmen diesen entgegensteuern um dadurch langfristig auf das Wohlbefinden der Mitarbeiter und somit der Gesellschaft einzuzahlen.\\r\
Der Einsatz von Technologie kann dabei heutzutage einen gro\\u00dfen Mehrwert bieten.\\r\

\\r\
New is The Apps for Europe http://appsforeurope.eu Business Lounge, organised by Waag Society, Kennisland and Open State. The aim of the Business Lounge is to support open data apps to move from a concept or prototype phase into a business start-up. It will prepare participants for the Apps for Europe competition. The best applicants will be selected to exclusively meet experts in the morning and investors and incubators in the afternoon.\\r\
\\r\
Special guest at the hackathon is J\\u00falia Keseru, international program coordinator of the US-based Sunlight Foundation http://sunlightfoundation.com , an organisation that uses the internet to catalyse greater government openness and transparency.\\r\
\\r\
During the workshops the Open Education Data network will launch its own API with quality information on schools and together with Amsterdam\\u2019s Centre Disctrict as first local government, we will launch Openspending in the Netherlands. The aim is to make financial data accessible and create transparency of these data for the public. The disclosure of financial information by governments as open data provides a more transparent and efficient government.\\r\

\\r\
**Important note:** Due to the limited capacity of the venue, all hackers *MUST* be registered at http://hack.tvot.tv to be allowed in. Joining this hackathon on Hacker League is only for registered hackers to submit their hacks, and does not get you into the event.\\r\
\\r\
The Hackathon is not only meant to honor the innovative spirit of Philo Farnsworth, the originator of electronic television, but will take place in the very building where Farnsworth invented electronic television back in 1927!\\r\
\\r\
What is the TV of Tomorrow? We\'ll leave that entirely up to your vision and creativity! However, it could encompass such platforms, technologies and user experiences as the second screen (smartphones, tablets, etc.), game consoles, connected set-top boxes, smart TV\'s, gestural control, voice control, automatic content recognition, augmented reality, rich interactivity, gamification, personalization, audience participation, social media integration, geolocation, transmedia storytelling, and more.\\r\
\\r\
#The Challenge\\r\
Hackers will be challenged to envision the TV of Tomorrow by conceiving, designing and building TV/video apps and experiences, primarily--though not exclusively--using technologies, platforms, content and knowledge contributed by the Hackathon hosts and sponsors. Special emphasis will be placed on apps and experiences that employ broadcast synchronization, rich metadata and natural user interfaces (a number of Leap Motion Controllers will be available for participants to use), and that explore the relationship between TV and the second screen; however, participants are ultimately free to implement their visions of the TV of Tomorrow however they wish. Hackers will receive points for every participating company\'s technology that they employ and, most importantly, for the originality, elegance and usefulness (viability, scalability, monetizability etc.) of the app or experience they create.  \\r\
\\r\
#How to Register \\r\
Registration is free, but spaces are limited. So register [here](http://hack.tvot.tv) soon to request your seat.

\\r\
We\\u2019re convening a hackathon on the weekend of June 1-2 in New York City at The Center for Social Innovation, and want YOU to be a part of it.  At this hackathon, we\\u2019re bringing together developers and creative technologists to focus their design and coding chops on compelling K-12 learning needs.  \\r\
\\r\
This hackathon will consist of two tracks:\\r\
1 \\u2013 Design + Build your own learning apps or games that address high impact needs and themes surfaced by EDesign Lab.  Make and show what a digital learning experience could be \\u2014 that might take the shape of a web app, a mobile phone app, an interactive game, a physical interface, a kinect hack.  \\r\
2 - Contribute to open source prototypes of K12 learning applications that have been tested in schools and prototyped by EDesign Lab. We encourage project forks and entrepreneurial adoptions of these projects. We would love for folks to adapt, extend, or otherwise tinker with them and imagine creative ways to utilize them with students.\\r\
\\r\
Unique to this hackathon, we\\u2019ll be sprinkling in playful ways to push creative energies along, exploring open data, and sharing some rapid prototyping methodologies.\\r\
\\r\
Share your makes with each other and a set of inventive judges (from TED-Ed, Teach for America, Big Spaceship, Blueridge Foundation, Fast Company, and Lerer Ventures).  Compelling hacks and hackathon winners will have the opportunity to get feedback and a pilot session in a school(s), consultation with Mozilla WebFWD (an Open Innovation Accelerator Program), and a mentorship meeting with DreamIt Ventures.\\r\
\\r\
Only those in attendance will be considered for judging.  Visit our website: http://www.edesignlabs.org/hackathon\\r\

Despite the recent wave of digital disruption and innovation that has swept over communication and identification technologies, the funding and exchange of goods, the design and manufacturing of objects and desires in urban life, digital technologies have yet to similarly transform much of the structural conditions and character of the spaces we inhabit every day. This hackathon invites technologists to upend architecture, to bring the spaces we inhabit and how we inhabit them into the 21st century.\\r\
\\r\
From atmospheres of sound, light and air, to property ownership, discovery and sharing, to design processes, procurement and compensation, to development investment, execution and marketing, to neighborhood planning, organization and communal living, the habitat presents a broad spectrum of variables for hacking away at, into and through the lived environment. As part of the [New Museum\\u2019s Ideas City festival](http://www.ideas-city.org/), rather than hacking the API of a nascent digital platform, framework, library or product, we will provide physical space, a habitat to be hacked.\\r\
\\r\
The house as API:\\r\
For the Hackathon, teams will be given the designs for a building proposed for New York City to think through and prototype means of using new design methodologies and technologies to re-invent domestic habitats. We invite hackers of hardware and software, as well as architects and designers to design and develop new elements to plug in to, augment, support and disrupt the technological apparatus of a home, ranging from physical space to communication, exchange, sharing and any other element of domestic living, whether physical or virtual.\\r\
\\r\
All parties interested in contributing to the new habitat are welcome to join us for a two-day hackathon on April 27-28 at the [New Lab in the Brooklyn Navy Yards](http://newlab.com/news-blog/2013/3/28/new-lab-featured-in-fast-company). Teams will present their ideas for disrupting habitats to a jury of technologists, visionaries, architects, decision makers at the end of the second day to receive feedback on their ideas and presentations. They will then have a public stage to present during the New Museum\\u2019s Ideas City Festival on Friday, May 3.\\r\

\\r\
###Agenda###\\r\
There are two parts to the Disrupt Hackathon:\\r\
\\r\
* **The Hacking**, where over 1200 hackers will build something awesome from scratch between 12:30pm Saturday to 10:00am Sunday. \\r\
* **The Demoing**, where the hacks will be demoed before judges, the media, other hackers and the public.\\r\
\\r\
You can find out more details on our [schedule](/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013/wikipages/517ad5a571fa4a5b42000010).\\r\
\\r\
###The Wifi###\\r\
You\'ll obviously need wifi. Here\'s how to access it:\\r\
\\r\
Network Name: disruptNYC_5\\r\
Password: disrupt13\\r\
\\r\
###The Hacking###\\r\
Hackers will build something awesome from scratch, either individually or in teams. \\r\
\\r\
Since you\'re short on time and the aim is to impress the judges and win some of the awesome prizes on offer, you\'re encouraged to make heavy use of [APIs and resources](/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013/wikipages/517ad72171fa4a5b42000014) (see the links on the left). We\'ll also have a series of [API workshops on Saturday afternoon](/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013/wikipages/517ad5afca7f1575db000009) with experts on hand to answer your questions and keep you hacking, not scratching your head.\\r\
\\r\
Each Hack will need to be registered on our platform as a Project; you and your team-mates will also need to register as users on our platform (powered by [HackerLeague](https://www.hackerleague.org)).\\r\
\\r\
*Creating (and later submitting) your project is the only way you\'ll be able to get to demo your hack (and win prizes and free tickets to Disrupt) on Sunday*.\\r\
\\r\
###The Demoing###\\r\
You\'ll have until 10:00am on Sunday, April 28th submit your project/hack. When you submit your hack, you\'ll be given a number which is the order in which you\'ll present your hack.\\r\
\\r\
At 11:00am, presentations will begin in the main hall.  You will bring your device onto the stage, and have 1 minute to demo your hack.  If you take longer than one minute, you will be publicly embarrassed.  \\r\
\\r\
Three hacks will be selected by the judges for demoing during this week\'s Disrupt conference.\\r\
\\r\
One hack will be awarded $5k for the Best Hack of the event.\\r\
\\r\
Each team that demos their Hack on stage on Sunday will be eligible for two tickets to the main Disrupt conference, valued at almost $3000 each.","external_url":"","state":"complete","start_time":"2013-04-27T16:30:00Z","end_time":"2013-04-28T14:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/51780acb0037d7766e000048/original.jpg?1366821595","students_only":false,"total_hackers":444,"total_hacks":181,"location":{"city":"NYC","state":"NY","country":"USA"},"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013"},{"id":"5172f2523891080e890000e7","name":"Save-A-thon: A Hackathon to save a Stanford Professor\'s life!","slug":"save-a-thon-a-hackathon-to-save-a-stanford-professors-life","description":"Calling all makers *(you don\'t have to be a hacker)*!

*Hello!  Our dear friend and colleague, Nalini Ambady (Stanford Psych Professor), is in urgent need of a bone marrow donor (as a S. Asian, her odds are 1 in 20,000 of finding a match). Come to SAVE-A-THON (TOMORROW @ d.school) to help build products & campaigns that improve the odds for all S. Asians.  Her match is out there and we need YOUR help finding it!*\\r\
\\r\
*Nalini Ambady is a beloved friend, renowned researcher and professor at Stanford University, and the active mom of two teenage daughters, Maya and Leena. She is also fighting for her life.

Now, she urgently needs a bone marrow transplant from a genetically matched donor. Someone out there is a perfect match, but they may not be on the registry yet. That someone can literally save her life - and it could be you. Nalini needs your help.*\\r\
\\r\
\\r\
*Nalini Ambady is a social psychologist. She is currently a Professor at Stanford University in the Department of Psychology.

We are hosting a 24-hour API Hackathon this coming April 6-7 in our Mashape Hacker House at 433 Bryant St., San Francisco.  You can check out the venue here http://www.facebook.com/mashape .  \\r\
\\r\
__What\'s the Hackathon about?__\\r\
We\'d like to see you build web or mobile applications from any \\"Machine Learning\\" APIs out there.  Examples of these APIs include text processing, sentiment analysis, face recognition... like the ingredients you need to \\"humanize\\" a robot :P\\r\
\\r\
We will serve lunch and dinner on Day 1.  You will be required to be onsite at the start of the hackathon.  You can continue coding at home and come back the next day for the demo.\\r\
\\r\
__The Prizes__\\r\
The winner gets to choose between a [Lego Mindstorm NXT 2.0](http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/products/default.aspx) or a [Sphero ball](http://store.gosphero.com/)! Oh and [Yactraq](http://yactraq.com) is giving away $500 to the best app that uses the Yactraq API :) (Soon to be up in Mashape).\\r\

[Boston Baseball Hack Day](http://baseballhackday.com) is on March 30, 2013, is the second annual hacking event where area baseball minds come together, form a team, and collaborate to create baseball-related project and bring an idea to life. The goal of the day is to bring creative minds into one room and see what they can produce within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, simple web app, website, or data visualization. It is also a great opportunity to network and socialize among like-minded people. Projects will be judged by area experts, and a brief awards ceremony (with prizes courtesy of our sponsors) will conclude the program.\\r\

War of the Worlds - UF\'s 1st Annual Code and Design War, is a team coding/design competition with a common goal: to develop the app that will \\"save the world\\".\\r\
 \\r\
Together with your team, you will spend 54 hours hacking on code to develop an application designed to \\"save humanity\\". But this is no ordinary competition...\\r\
 \\r\
Everytime your team completes a goal, you receive a \\"powerup\\" that can change the rules of the game, push your team into the lead, or set other teams behind. Only the best teams will survive.\\r\
 \\r\
Throughout the competition you\'ll receive mentorship from our sponsors, FREE FOOD AND DRINKS, and FREE T-SHIRTS!\\r\
 \\r\
Besides \\"saving humanity\\", winning teams will be endowed with illustrious prizes! \\r\
 \\r\
Register before February 16th, and get FREE ADMISSION! \\r\
\\r\
Planning your team in advance? (You can join teams while there also)\\r\
All teams need to have 1 UI Digerati, 1 Mobile Apps Ninja, and 1 Server Jedi. (You can have more, you just need at least 1 of each. You can go as an individual and join another team too!)\\r\
 \\r\
The Backstory (Abridged):\\r\
--------------------------------------------\\r\
The Year: 2300\\r\
The Place: Gainesville, FL\\r\
Your Mission: Develop and design the app to save humanity.\\r\
 \\r\
After years of war ravaging the global community, mass famines have struck the globe, leaving millions without food or water. Humanity teeters on the brink of extinction, as plagues continue to breed hordes of zombies that ravage the land. The world has split into factions, all vying for control of the remaining resources. All hope for humanity appears lost.\\r\
 \\r\
That is it would be, if not for the discovery of an ancient temple and the blueprints within. The blueprints to a replicator that can regenerate the world with the help of the Ancients.\\r\
 \\r\
You and your team are humanity\'s last hope. In 48 hours, the zombie horde will close in on your last stronghold. Without the replicator, you cannot hope to survive.\\r\
 \\r\
Good luck. The Ancients are preparing the data for the replicator. More information to come soon!\\r\

Spring Break\\r\
-----------\\r\
We realize that for some, this event may fall just as spring break is starting or ending. Sadly, this was the only available time we could get the space required for the hackathon. For those attending the hack and who may have luggage with them (we\'re thinking here of TCNJ students moving back into the dorms on Sunday afternoon after the hackathon), we\'ll be providing a locked room in which to store your luggage during the hackathon so that we don\'t need to pile it up in the hackspace.\\r\
\\r\
And hey, who wants to go to a warm beach resort during spring break anyway? \\r\

\\r\
Hack The Hackathon\\u2019s developer competition is an event designed for attendees (technical & non-technical) to build apps/mobile apps, get fed, compete for prizes across different categories, work with expert mentors, meet new people, and scout for teammates to work on new or current projects. Our hackathon presents an opportunity to experiment with mobile application development platforms, APIs, and \\u201csmart\\u201d devices and to address an array of possible projects falling loosely into three broad categories:\\r\
\\r\
Social Good Challenge - Mobile apps and social media are bringing opportunity and aid in ways we could not have imaged. Can you develop an app that helps improve the quality of life for people in war-torn, drought or hunger-stricken communities? We have prizes for teams willing to take the challenge and build applications for good!\\r\
\\r\
Smarter Living Challenge \\u2013 Using motion, voice, and other sensory data, and combining them with cloud-based data sources (from social media streams and other feeds), the goal is to help people be more responsive and sensitive toward one another and make better use of the technology that surrounds them. Whether for connected vehicles, wearable computing, home automation, toys, travel, entertainment, or shopping, these apps come together in a dramatic real-world road test that you will not want to miss! Educational apps for early childhood through to continuing adult and elderly education; apps for patients, healthcare practitioners, medical facilities, and healthcare payers; and social services apps for utilities, carriers, governments, and non-profits revolutionizing the way basic services are delivered to the most advanced and to the most needy people on the planet.\\r\
\\r\
Sustainable Business Challenge \\u2013 Just like governments and human rights groups, companies are also trying to make life better for their employees and their customers. By making mundane business tasks more like games, employers can improve customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. This challenge aims to make the workplace more productive, more efficient, and more fun. The concepts behind many of the most popular consumer apps and games can be applied in enterprise environments to promote employee engagement, workforce productivity, quality control, accountability, health and environmental safety.\\r\
\\r\
Collaboration is key to success in a Hackathon and that fact has not gone unnoticed by governments wishing to foster the exchange of innovation and ideas between and among different countries around the globe. In addition to the three general themes and the independent challenges set forth by our technology sponsors, each event includes recognition and reward for individuals who distinguish themselves during the event in learning, exploration, sharing, building, and mastery. \\r\

Cleanweb apps sometimes focus on sharing resources like ViaCycle\\u2019s bike sharing program or sometimes they make life more accessible like optimized transit routes between MARTA, the Atlanta Beltline and Midtown.  A Hackathon is a short collaborative innovation session designed to rapidly develop new ideas and implementations. Usually teams form around common interests, develop a reasonable goal, and devise a plan to use their team\\u2019s skills to reach that goal in the time allowed. The time constraint forces teams to \\u201cmake it work\\u201d instead of \\u201cmake it perfect\\u201d, and adds a bit of excitement.\\r\

 \\r\
There will be happy hour drinks as a group organized at the end of both days. \\r\
 \\r\
There are two kinds of tickets available. One comes with the Sparkfun inventor\'s kit that you can use for the weekend. We reccommend this ticket if you don\'t already have a project you are working on. \\r\
 \\r\
 The money from ticket sales is going towards food/drink for the weekend. We aren\'t working with sponsors. \\r\
 \\r\
PLEASE NOTE: Johnny-five does not yet support Windows. Windows users should have an OSX or Linux VM\\u2014or be willing to land support for windows before the event. \\r\

Aaron Swartz, a visionary, a hacktivist and a hero for his work authoring technologies that form the backbone of the web, passed away recently. Aaron defied the powers that be, and fought for the free dissemination of information. Even though he is gone, his work will not be forgotten. \\r\
\\r\
Come celebrate the life and continue the work of Aaron Swartz at the first global hackathon in Aaron\'s memory. Our challenge is to look for ways to continue Aaron\'s work through creative projects that can bring us closer to his vision of an open and free world.\\r\

C4C aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem in which nonprofits, government agencies, and global NGOs can leverage the home-base talents of the New York corporate and technology sector in an ongoing, rather than one-time basis.\\r\
\\r\
C4C is a multi-stage process that moves from challenge development & needs matching to short sprint, agile programming events, and on to showcasing results that are oriented toward sustainable solutions. C4C recognizes the value of innovative, nimble approaches like hackathons and app contests but also realizes that meaningful challenges cannot be solved overnight.\\r\
\\r\
Technology challenges will be sourced and developed by top tier organizations including DoSomething.org, the White House Office of Social Innovation and New York City\'s technology office. Civic minded technologists and \\"hackers\\" will take up those challenges by developing and presenting innovative solutions. The best solutions will be recognized with prizes, accolades and access to further resources.\\r\
\\r\
C4C is a big-tent partnership led by NYU Wagner\'s School of Public Service, One Economy, Code for America and NPower, in association with the Blue Ridge Foundation. The creativity kicks off this summer, when we\'ll begin sourcing and developing challenges from government and nonprofits. We\'ll present the challenges through our web site and invite teams to commit to solving challenges. Beginning September 28th, the work will intensify during a two-week competition period. Teams will formally come together to draft business charters that detail each member\'s role and responsibility in the competition. Teams will work between September 28 and October 12 to develop their entries into the competition. On October 12th, entries will judged and prizes will be awarded. Partnership will be encouraged beyond the competition as awards include foundation support, incubation space, mentorships, and VC lunches.\\r\

The goal is to create real solutions to the technology challenges facing nonprofit organizations or benefit corporations by engaging some of New York\\u2019s best developers, designers and project managers. Unlike some hackathons, this isn\\u2019t just a contest or opportunity to show off, it\\u2019s an opportunity to make a real difference for an organization that is doing good in the world by solving a technology problem for them.\\r\
\\r\
Helping Hacks will kickoff on Friday August 24th with a pitch session and happy hour mixer, and continue through the weekend of the 25th and 26th. The weekend begins with the organizations pitching their needs and projects to the attendees, and drafting teams of developers, designers, and project managers to join them in creating a solution. At the end of the event, the solutions are presented and prizes awarded based on creativity, elegance, effectiveness and overall awesomeness. The event will be hosted at The Hatchery\\u2019s coworking space at 500 7th Ave, Manhattan.\\r\
\\r\
If you are an organization or benefit corporation with a technology project that needs help - anything from an idea for an awesome web app to a new website design, we want to hear from you! Fill out the contact form to let us know about your project and we\'ll get back to you with more details and a plan.\\r\
\\r\
If you are a hacker, designer, developer, database guru or project manager, we need your help! We\'re looking to get probably up to 75 hackers together for this event, and we\'ll need a range of skills to make it happen. So fill out the contact form and let us know you\'re interested, and we\'ll put you on the list.\\r\
\\r\
We will also need some non-techy people to volunteer and help manage the event, so if you\'re interested in attending but not as a hacker or an organization, fill out the contact form as a volunteer and we\'ll let you know how you can help. Anyone with hackathon experience should make note of that in the notes field. Aside from helping during the event we will also need help with designing the Helping Hacks logo and website, doing PR and marketing, event planning, tech management, etc so if you want to help in those ways please let us know.\\r\
\\r\
Finally, if you\'re interested in sponsoring this event, please contact nate@goodnik.org directly. We expect this event will cost about $7500 and we\'ll need a lot of help to pull it off. Any help you can provide, whether it\'s cash, swag, prizes, food or beer would be greatly appreciated.\\r\

\\r\
Investigating how technologies such as mobile & cellular communication, crowd-sourced mapping, remote data plotting and covert data transfer can contribute to monitoring of the electoral process in countries where domestic and international observation is restricted. We\'ll be looking particularly at how to address the key issue of corroboration/verification, and running at least a couple of country specific workshops looking at practicalities - Zimbabwe and Iran look likely topics for those at present.\\r\
We\'re also currently in dicussions with several other interested organisations about running other projects on the day. More details to follow soon.\\r\

The hackathon has a new twist this year \\u2013 developers will compete for prizes in \\u201cIron Chef\\u201d style challenges that will be announced at the start of the event.\\r\
\\r\
Mobile DevCamp is inspired by BarCamp, SuperHappyDevHouse, and MacHack, to develop cloud applications for iPhones, iPads and Android devices of all kinds. This follows the previous iPhoneDevCamp events held in Palo Alto since 2007 and in NYC since 2009. Out of town guests are welcome.  Attendees will include Apple iOS developers, Google Android developers, web developers, UI designers, and testers, all working together over the weekend. \\r\
\\r\
The event will kick off on Friday night with a mixer and keynote address by CodeFab CEO, Alex Cone, at our Hell\\u2019s Kitchen party location.  Saturday morning will begin with speakers on cloud computing and a round table discussion of the issues and solutions integrating cloud and mobile technologies. This year our hackathon will be held at a fantastic Tribeca space at 60 Reade Street where developers will be provided free wifi, pizza and energy drinks.  In response to overwhelming demand, hackers will be able to hack until midnight on Saturday - 6 more hacking hours than in previous years!  Sunday will see the conclusion of the Hackathon Challenge, with team presentations of each entry, an awards ceremony, and, for best application in show, prizes of new iPad 3s for the winning team!\\r\

## Event Overview\\r\
\\r\
The event is a 24-hour hackathon. It will begin on April 21th at 11:00am and conclude on April 22th at 3:00pm EST. We will have several companies presenting their technologies so that students can create original applications in unique and interesting ways. Last year, we had over 150 students in attendance, and we are aiming to double the turnout this year.\\r\
\\r\
This event is open to anyone willing to spend the weekend hacking for honor and glory. There is no limit to the size of a team but remember that the bigger the team, the harder it is to manage a project. We are looking forward to seeing some awesome hacks and some awesome hackers.\\r\

The Wall Street Journal is inviting developers to help build free Web tools that promote data transparency and control.\\r\
\\r\
What do we mean by \\"data transparency and control\\"?\\r\
\\r\
One of the fastest-growing businesses in the world is the use of your data. When you browse the Internet, your movements are recorded by hundreds of tracking companies. When you walk down the street, your cellphone is transmitting your location. Items you post on Facebook and Twitter are being monitored by employers, insurers and others.\\r\
\\r\
The Wall Street Journal documented the concerns raised by this surveillance in its \\u201c<a href=\\"http://online.wsj.com/public/page/what-they-know-digital-privacy.html\\">What They Know</a>\\u201d series. Now, the Journal is seeking to promote tools that let people see and control their personal data. Over three crisp spring days in New York, the Journal will host about a hundred developers at its first-ever Data Transparency Weekend. The programmers will form teams to work on free Web tools that promote data transparency; at the end of the weekend, the best tools will win prizes and be publicly recognized.","external_url":"http://datatransparency.wsj.com/","state":"complete","start_time":"2012-04-13T22:00:00Z","end_time":"2012-04-15T20:00:00Z","logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackerleague-production/organizations/logos/4f3aa2a5467152000100002e/original.png?1332022875","students_only":false,"total_hackers":118,"total_hacks":29,"location":false,"url":"http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/wsj-data-transparency-code-a-thon"},{"id":"4f58545009c1e10001000006","name":"Claremont Colleges Hackathon","slug":"claremont-colleges-hackathon","description":"Hosted by Pomona College on April 6th from 8pm to 8am in the Pomona Computer Science Building.\\r\

We\'ll be hacking all night, making some awesome things, giving out some great prizes, and having a whole lot of fun. \\r\
\\r\
The theme of this hackathon is \\"build something a 5C student would love to use.\\" Some of the projects people are considering working on are: a course recommendation engine and website for the 5Cs, an easier way to quickly share files, and a better aggregation site of 5C building hours. What can you think up?\\r\

To help you brainstorm, checkout the APIs on the left hand side and get inspired!\\r\

ABOUT: \\r\
\\r\
The original Photo Hack Day was the first image-centric hackathon that brought together the brightest minds in photography, photo-editing, web design, computer science, and more. In 24 hours, over 200 developers put together an impressive 43 hacks with APIs contributed from 25 companies -- a full day display of burgeoning talent in the New York City tech community.\\r\
\\r\
Six months later, we\'re back with another open call to developers and designers. On February 25-26, 2012, Aviary is throwing Photo Hack Day 2 with our partners at General Assembly, and we want all of you to come.\\r\

You\\u2019ll get hands-on experience with both the technical and business aspects of doing a startup, and you\\u2019ll add an awesome project to your portfolio.\\r\
\\r\
##I\\u2019m not sure whether I want to get a job/internship or work on my own startup. Is this for me?\\r\
Regardless of whether you want to actually build a startup, apply to Y-Combinator/TechStars/some other accelerator, or simply find a great internship (or job), this week will be super useful. Lots of companies (especially startups) ask you to show them something you\\u2019ve built. This is a chance to not only have something to show, but something that\\u2019s truly awesome and polished.\\r\
\\r\
##What is the timeline of the event?\\r\
HackPrinceton Start Week kicks off with its welcome event Sunday, January 29th. Classes and talks run from Sunday to Friday, Saturday is a no-distractions, heads-down hacking day, and teams demo their products Sunday, February 5th. If you are unable to make demo day or the day before, that is fine, but teams should be present for the first 6 days of Start Week.\\r\
\\r\
##What if I don\\u2019t have a team yet?\\r\
If you would like to meet others to form a team or would like to learn more, we will be having a mix-n-mingle and kickoff event.\\r\
\\r\
##Do I have to be a programmer or designer?\\r\
You do not have to be a programmer or designer, but should be on a team with at least one. See the question above.\\r\
\\r\
##So I build a product, then what?\\r\
We encourage you to enter both this event and TigerLaunch, as there is enormous synergy between the programs (hack during StartWeek, present at TigerLaunch, then apply for accelerators). Think of this as a track designed to prepare you for entrepreneurship out in the wild or an awesome summer internship (or job). You\\u2019ve got what it takes.
